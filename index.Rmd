# A little about this manual 

This manual is written in **Markdown** and managed with git/Github. 

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.  Use second (`##`) and third (`###`) level headings for sections in each chapter. 

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
