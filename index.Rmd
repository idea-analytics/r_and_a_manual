# A little about this manual {#about}

The *IDEA R&A Manual*  is [IDEA Public Schools'](www.ideapublicschools.org) Research & Analysis Team's ever evolving encyclopedia of resources and best practices.  It's purpose is to make any R&A team member's (or really any other interested reader's) job easier, by sharing how we do our jobs.   

The manual is particularly aimed at a technical audience (e.g. statisticians, data analysts, data engineers, data scientists) and most contributions are from technical authors. Indeed, the expectation is that technical members for the R&A team will contribute to this manual regularly (i.e., weekly or daily during the festive (information) harvesting celebration of Doctoberfest)


```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```


## What goes in this manual?

Anything and everything we learn during the course of our work at IDEA. Of particular help is any information, learning, or insights, but some topics that are especially useful to your colleages (and our future self) include:

* Locations of important tables in [the data warehouse][The Data Warehouse]
* Information about how to use data in the warehouse (e.g. how do you [identify students in CSI](#csi)
* Links and examples to useful R packages
* [Tips and tricks] in R, SQL, or Python that you discover in the course of your work 
* Templates:  output templates, input templates, [ProjectTemplates](#section-ProjectTemplate), . . . all the templates.
