# Visualization Standards

## IDEA Branding

When producing a visualization for presentation or publication, use the [IDEA 2024 Branding Guidelines](https://brandfolder.com/ideapublicschools) established by the [Marketing team](https://ideapublicschoolsorg.sharepoint.com/sites/MCE/SitePages/Marketing-Team.aspx). Many of these guidelines, particularly colors, have already been incorporated into an R package, `ideacolors`.


### The `ideacolors` package

The `ideacolors` package is used in conjunction with `ggplot2` to produce graphs and visualizations consistent with the primary and secondary brand color schemes. For more information, consult the `ideacolors` [documentation](https://idea-analytics.github.io/ideacolors/).

To install the package, use the following code:

```{r ideacolors, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("idea-analytics/ideacolors")
```

#### `ideacolors` themes and scales

Consider the following chart using the `mtcars` data set, where we create a scatter plot of engine displacement by fuel efficiency measured in miles per gallon where we've set the color aesthetic (or channel) to the number of cylinders a car's engine has: 

```{r get_plot}
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=disp, y=mpg)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=as_factor(cyl)))

p
```

You can quickly apply IDEA brand compliant colors by using the `scale_color_idea()` function:

```{r apply_scale_color_idea}
library(ideacolors)

p +
  scale_color_idea()
```

**Super easy!**  We can also easily change the palette and even reverse it:

```{r reverse_palette}
p +
  scale_color_idea(palette = "blueorange", reverse = TRUE)
```

Available palettes are given in the `idea_palettes` variable and can be seen here:

```{r swatchplot}
colorspace::swatchplot(idea_palettes)
```

#### Differences between branding guidelines

The branding guidelines released in 2024 modifies the 2019 color palette and removes the `magenta` accent in favor of a `vermillion` accent. To switch between palettes, use the `year` argument in `scale_color_idea()` or `scale_fill_idea()`. Note the default behavior is to use the most recent branding guidelines available (in this case, `year = 2024`).

```{r switch_guidelines}
p +
  scale_color_idea(year = 2019)
```

For more information on using the different branding guidelines, please refer to the [package vignette](https://idea-analytics.github.io/ideacolors/articles/switching-guidelines.html).

### Color Blindness

Note that IDEA's brand colors are not completely safe for color blindness.  Here's each palette with adjustments to check for the predominant types of color blindness in the population:

```{r swatchplot_cb}
colorspace::swatchplot(idea_palettes, cvd = c("desaturate", 'deutan', "protan", "tritan"))
```


::: {.tip}
The chart above includes the following types of color blindness:

* Deuteranopia: Deuteranopia is a type of color blindness that primarily affects the perception of the green color spectrum. People with deuteranopia have a deficiency or absence of the green cone cells in their eyes, which are responsible for perceiving green light. As a result, they have **difficulty distinguishing between green and red hues**. The red and green colors may appear more similar or indistinguishable to individuals with deuteranopia.

* Protanopia: Protanopia is a type of color blindness that primarily affects the perception of the red color spectrum. Individuals with protanopia lack or have a reduced number of functional red cone cells in their eyes. Consequently, they **struggle to differentiate between red and green colors**. They may perceive these colors as muted or similar in appearance.

* Tritanopia: Tritanopia, also known as blue-yellow color blindness, is a rarer form of color blindness that affects the perception of the blue and yellow color spectrum. People with tritanopia have a deficiency or absence of the blue cone cells in their eyes, leading to **difficulty in distinguishing between blue and yellow colors**.

### Race/Ethnicity Colors

When creating visuals of Race/Ethnicity we want to be consistent with the colors chosen for each race/ethnicity. Additionally, we want to ensure that the colors are not offensive to any group. Below are the colors that were used for all of the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) work that has been completed in the last couple of months of 2022.

  + **American Indian/Alaskan Native:** idea_colors$melon (#F9A054)
  + **Asian:** idea_colors$cyan (#53B4CC)
  + **Black:** idea_colors$magenta (#EE3A80)
  + **Hispanic:** idea_colors$blue (#0079C1)
  + **Multi-racial:** idea_colors$lime (#A4C364)
  + **Other:** idea_colors$yellow (#FFDE75)
  + **Pacific Islander:** idea_colors$darkblue (#1A4789)
  + **White:** idea_colors$coolgray (#626363)
  
Suppose your data frame, `df_reading_levels`, contains information about Academy students' grade-level reading equivalents `GradeLevelEquivalent` with race and ethnicity in the `RaceEthnicity` column. To create a visualization of reading levels using the custom palette, you'll need to code the palette in three places:

1. as a vector of colors, outside of the plotting function
2. as an aesthetic, inside the initial plotting call
3. as a value, inside a manual scale function

Let's define the palette as a vector. You may need to adjust the names of the race or ethnicity to match the factors in your data frame.

```{r vector_colors, eval=FALSE}
# step 1
race_ethnicity_legend <- c("American Indian" = idea_colors$melon,
                           "Asian" = idea_colors$cyan,
                           "Black" = idea_colors$magenta,
                           "Hispanic" = idea_colors$blue,
                           "Other" = idea_colors$yellow,
                           "Pacific Islander" = idea_colors$darkblue,
                           "Two or more races" = idea_colors$lime,
                           "White" = idea_colors$coolgray)
```

Then, inside a `geom_*()` layer, assign the appropriate column `RaceEthnicity` to the appropriate aesthetic `aes()`. (Depending on your visualization, the aesthetic might be `fill`, `shape`, etc.).

```{r geom_aes, eval=FALSE}
# step 2
ggplot(df_reading_levels) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = GradeLevelEquivalent,
                   color = RaceEthnicity))
```

One additional call is needed to force `ggplot()` to use the palette you specified earlier.

```{r scale_color_manual, eval=FALSE}
# step 2
ggplot(df_reading_levels) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = GradeLevelEquivalent,
                   color = RaceEthnicity)) +
  # other layers go here... +
  # step 3
  scale_color_manual(values = race_ethnicity_legend,
                     drop = FALSE) +
  labs(color = "Race / Ethnicity")
```

The `scale_color_manual()` call will accept the vector of colors specified earlier in `values`, and `drop = FALSE` forces the legend to show all possible values and colors of `race_ethnicity_legend`, regardless if they appear in the `RaceEthnicity` column. (If the aesthetic is `fill`, then use `scale_fill_manual(values = race_ethnicity_legend, drop = FALSE)`, and so on).

The default legend title is to use the column name. However, the `labs()` call *relabels* the legend title for the `color` aesthetic to "Race / Ethnicity". (If the aesthetic is `fill`, then use `labs(fill = "Race / Ethnicity")`, and so on).

### Grade Level Colors

If your visualization or reporting requires grouping across grade levels, using the IDEA polo color for that grade level is a familiar palette for IDEA schools. For more information about uniforms, refer to the [parent guide](https://ideapublicschools.org/parents/uniform-guides/).

The following are the current polo colors for each grade level:

  Grade Level | Color 
  ------------|-------
 PK-5th, 8th | Blue
 6th, 10th | Red
 7th, 11th | Orange
 9th | Green
 12th | Black
 
Clearly, if all grade levels are present on one plot and cannot be individually labeled (say, a scatterplot), then using one color for multiple grade levels is not advised. However, if color coding a document or table where colors can be repeated, then this palette can provide visual cues to contextualize the report.

### Separation Colors
When reporting on separation reasons from Tyler Munis (located in the reporting.employees table), the following colors should be used:

+ **Failed I-9 Verification:** light yellow (#FFDE75)
+ **Involuntary Misconduct:** pink (#EE3A80)
+ **Involuntary Non-Renew:** light blue (#BDD7EE)
+ **Involuntary Poor Performance:** navy blue (#1A4789)
+ **No Call No Show:** light purple (#CD9BFF)
+ **Resign in Lieu of Termination:** green (#00B050)
+ **Voluntary Resignation No Notice:** orange (#F9A054)
+ **Voluntary Resignation With Notice:** blue (#0079C1)
+ **Voluntary No Return From Leave:** light green (#A4C364)
+ **Voluntary Retirement:** dark grey (#626363)
+ **Job Change to Seasonal/Part-Time:** tan (#E5C09F)
+ **Did not Return Next Year in FT Position:** dark green (#214F28)


### IDEA Palette Color Ramp

To obtain a color ramp of the IDEA palette with hex codes, use following R code:

```{r show idea palette ramp, eval = FALSE}
# load libraries
library(ideacolors)
library(scales)

show_col(idea_palette_ramp()(___) # substitute blank with the number of colors desired
```

As an example, the IDEA palette color ramp for six colors is as follows:

```{r idea palette ramp 6 colors, eval = FALSE}
show_col(idea_palette_ramp()(6))
```

![IDEA palette color ramp with six colors](img/idea_palette_ramp_6.png "show_col(idea_palette_ramp()(6))"){width="500"}


### Typography

The primary brand font is Proxima Nova; the secondary fonts are Arial or Helvetica. Before using the code, ensure that these fonts have already been installed. Then, to add these fonts to a visualization, use the following code:

```{r fonts, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("showtext")
library(showtext)

showtext_auto()
font_add("proxima",
         regular = "proximanova-regular.ttf",
         bold = "proximanova-extrabold.ttf",
         italic = "proximanova-regularit.ttf",
         bolditalic = "proximanova-extraboldit.ttf")

# showtext_auto(FALSE) # revert back to default fonts
```

This code will apply the font consistently to all text in any visualization created for that R session. To stop using the custom fonts in a session, use `showtext_auto(FALSE)` to revert to the default fonts.

## Camp RIO branding

For Camp RIO-specific analyses, visualizations, or publications, use the [Camp RIO 2022 brand guidelines](https://brandfolder.com/ideapublicschools) from the Advancement and Marketing teams.

### Camp RIO scales

To use Camp RIO scales in a visualization, use `scale_color_camp_rio()` or `scale_fill_camp_rio()`. The default palette is `year = 2022`.

```{r scale_color_camp_rio}
p +
  scale_color_camp_rio()
```

### Camp RIO palette ramp

The palette ramp for Camp RIO is shown below:

```{r camp_rio_palette_ramp, eval = FALSE}
show_col(camp_rio_palette_ramp()(6))
```

![Camp RIO palette color ramp with six colors](img/camp-rio-palette-ramp-edit.png "show_col(camp_rio_palette_ramp()(6))"){width="500"}

### Typography

The primary brand fonts are Baloo and Baloo 2; the secondary fonts are Verveine, which is useful for taglines, and Assistant, which is useful for subheadings and body text.

## Visualizing Hierarchical Data

Our data is often presented and displayed hierarchically (e.g., state, then region, then school, etc.). Therefore, it may be useful to group visualizations in a hierarchy, rather than arranging them alphabetically or in another manner.

Let's use the [`gapminder`](https://jennybc.github.io/gapminder/) data in R, where each row is a life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita corresponding with a specific country in a specific year.

```{r gapminder_data, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
library(gapminder)

set.seed(1234)
sample <- gapminder::gapminder %>%
  distinct(country) %>%
  slice_sample(n = 10) %>%
  pull()

df_gapminder_sample <- gapminder::gapminder %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  filter(country %in% sample)

df_gapminder_sample %>%
  slice_head(n = 2) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

We could visualize the changes in life expectancy vs. GDP per capita over time like this:

```{r gapminder_unnested, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
df_gapminder_sample %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp,
             color = continent,
             alpha = year)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = pop)) +
  geom_path(size = 1) +
  
  # each country has a separate panel, arranged alphabetically by country
  facet_grid( ~ country,
                labeller = labeller(country = label_wrap_gen(width = 10)),
                scale = "free_x") +
  theme_idea_min() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8,
                                   angle = 90)) +
  labs(size = "Population",
       alpha = "Year",
       color = "Continent",
       x = "Per capita GDP",
       y = "Life expectancy",
       title = "Life expectancy vs. per capita GDP")

```

![This graph displays changes in life expectancy arranged alphabetically by country.](img/gapminder_unnested.png "Series of graphs displaying changes in life expectancy vs. per capita GDP over time, arranged alphabetically by country"){width="500"}

The line graphs are arranged alphabetically by country. However, it might be more visually appealing and intuitive to a reader if the graphs were arranged by continent and *then* country. To do this, we can use the `{ggh4x}` package [(documentation here)](https://teunbrand.github.io/ggh4x/articles/ggh4x.html), and switch from `facet_grid()` or `facet_wrap()` in `ggplot2` to `facet_nested()` or `facet_nested_wrap()` in `ggh4x`.

```{r gapminder_nested, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(ggh4x)

df_gapminder_sample %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp,
           color = continent,
           alpha = year)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = pop)) +
  geom_path(size = 1) +
  
  # each country has a separate panel,
  # but arranged alphabetically by continent, then by country
  facet_nested( ~ continent + country,
                labeller = labeller(country = label_wrap_gen(width = 10)),
                scale = "free_x") +
  theme_idea_min() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8,
                                   angle = 90)) +
  labs(size = "Population",
       alpha = "Year",
       color = "Continent",
       x = "Per capita GDP",
       y = "Life expectancy",
       title = "Life expectancy vs. per capita GDP")
```

![This graph displays changes in life expectancy arranged alphabetically by continent first, then country.](img/gapminder_nested.png "Series of graphs displaying changes in life expectancy vs. per capita GDP over time, arranged alphabetically by continent first, then country"){width="500"}


## Saving and publishing visualizations

Data visualization can also communicate our findings effectively to external (to R&A) audiences. Often, the graphs or tables we publish are included in slide decks or products around the organization. Thus, it is important to consider both the **quality** (i.e. plot resolution and size) and **device output** (e.g. .png, .pdf, .svg, etc.) of the visualization produced.

Often, clicking on `Plots -> Export -> Save as image...` produces a *low-resolution bitmap* (.bmp) that does not resize appropriately. It is suggested you use one of the following methods instead:

### Using device functions

To save a plot directly to a specified device, use the "output sandwich" method.

1. Open the device using a device function like `png()`, `pdf()`, `jpeg()`, etc.
2. Include the code to produce the output.
3. Close the device using `dev.off()`.

Suppose you needed to save an image as a .pdf file with dimensions 3 inches by 4 inches to the filename `01-my-high-quality-graph.pdf`. Then, the output sandwich would look like this:

```{r output_sandwich, eval=FALSE}
# 1. open the device
pdf(file = here::here("graphs", "01-my-high-quality-graph.pdf"),
    width = 3,
    height = 4)

# 2. include the code to produce the output
ggplot(my_data_frame) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = my_continuous_var)) +
  
  # other layers as needed
  labs(title = "My high quality graph")

# 3. close the device
dev.off()
```



### Using `ggsave()`

The function `ggsave()` provides a wrapper around multiple device functions, like `png()` or `pdf()`, but gives nice defaults for saving a high quality plot object to a device of your choice. It is suggested to use the function like this:

1. Build your plot and assign the plot object (`<-`).
2. Determine the dimensions, resolution, and output needed for the final product.
3. Use `ggsave()` with the specifications identified in step 2. Note: the file name MUST include the extension of the device.
4. Revise specifications as needed.

Suppose you need to include a plot (.png) that takes up about $\frac{1}{4}$ of a standard PowerPoint slide (16:9 widescreen). You might want to adjust the zoom (scale = 1.5), change the resolution (dpi = 320), and change the dimensions (6.5 inches by 6.5 inches). Then, the code would look like this:

```{r ggsave, eval=FALSE}
my_plot <- ggplot(my_data_frame) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = my_continuous_var)) +
  
  # other layers as needed
  labs(title = "My high quality graph")

ggsave(filename = here::here("graphs", "01-my-high-quality-graph.png"),
       plot = my_plot,
       scale = 1.5,
       width = 6.5,
       height = 6.5,
       units = "in",
       dpi = 320)
```
