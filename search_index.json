Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. Use second (##) and third (###) level headings for sections in each chapter. 1.1 What goes in this manual? 1.2 How do you contribute to this book? "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction Do merge requests work with branching with bookdown? You can or cannot label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!
