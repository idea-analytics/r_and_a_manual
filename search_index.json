[["index.html", "IDEA R&amp;A Manual Chapter 1 A little about this manual 1.1 What goes in this manual? 1.2 How do you contribute to this book?", " IDEA R&amp;A Manual Chris Haid, Edison Coronado, Mishan Jensen, Maura Carter, Steven Macapagal 2021-10-21 Chapter 1 A little about this manual The IDEA R&amp;A Manual is IDEA Public Schools’ Research &amp; Analysis Team’s ever evolving encyclopedia of resources and best practices. It’s purpose is to make any R&amp;A team member’s (or really any other interested reader’s) job easier, by sharing how we do our jobs. The manual is particularly aimed at a technical audience (e.g. statisticians, data analysts, data engineers, data scientists) and most contributions are from technical authors. Indeed, the expectation is that technical members for the R&amp;A team will contribute to this manual regularly (i.e., weekly or daily during the festive (information) harvesting celebration of Doctoberfest) 1.1 What goes in this manual? Anything and everything we learn during the course of our work at IDEA. Of particular help is any information, learning, or insights, but some topics that are especially useful to your colleages (and our future self) include: Locations of important tables in the data warehouse Information about how to use data in the warehouse (e.g. how do you identify students in CSI Links and examples to useful R packages Tips and tricks in R, SQL, or Python that you discover in the course of your work Templates: output templates, input templates, ProjectTemplates, . . . all the templates. 1.2 How do you contribute to this book? This manual is written in Markdown and managed with git/Github. If you are unfamiliar with git/Github you’ll want to read throughhow we use git in the Projects chapter The general process is as follows: Clone the repo: If you haven’t already, pull this book down from it’s Github repo. From the command line run git clone https://github.com/idea-analytics/r_and_a_manual.git. Or, pull down the latest version of the master branch git checkout master and then git pull In File Explorer/Finder find the r_and_a_manaul folder and double click r_and_a_manual.Rproj, which will open the book’s project in RStudio Check out a branch git checkout -b my-manual-update. Make updates. You can run in R bookdown::serve_book to have it recompile the book on save. Commit frequently. Push your changes on yoru branch up to Github. Intitiate a pull request to merge your changes. If they are minor you can do the whole process your self. IF they are major–especially changing the books structure–then have another team member review your pull request before merging. Complete the merge. Rinse and repeat! Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. Use second (##) and third (###) level headings for sections in each chapter. 1.2.1 Adding “Tips” and other callouts Do you see the blue box just above this section? That’s a tips box, but we have a few others you can add. Doing so is super simple by using a special block tag (:::) in your RMarkdown that creates a CSS-styled &lt;div&gt; block in the resulting HTML when this manual’s RMD files are rendered. Here’s an example. Writing this in your RMD: ::: {.tip} This is s a tip box! You should use this for quick callouts that are important pieces of hard-earned wisdom ::: Results in this: This is s a tip box! You should use this for quick callouts that are important pieces of hard-earned wisdom There are four other callout boxes we can use, each with a different icon: ::: {.rstudio-tip} This is an **RSTudio** Tip box This is s a different tip box to use for any sage advice regarding RStduio products like RStudio Connect, the RStudio IDE, or even RStudio supported packages. ::: ::: {.rstudio-tip} This is a **RSTudio** Tip box This is s a different tip box to use for any sage advice regarding RStduio products like RStudio Connect, the RStudio IDE, or even RStudio supported packages. ::: This is a RSTudio Tip box This is s a different tip box to use for any sage advice regarding RStudio products like RStudio Connect, the RStudio IDE, or even RStudio supported packages. ::: {.gotcha} This is a **gotcha** call out Warn your reader of things to look out for with this box. ::: This is a gotcha call out Warn your reader of things to look out for with this box. ::: {.design} This is a **design** call out This is great looking spot to provide extra advice on look-and-feel and design conventions. ::: This is a design call out This is great looking spot to provide extra advice on look-and-feel and design conventions. ::: {hat} This is a **hat** call out You get a hat! You can use this extra special tips that seem like magic. Or something like that. ::: This is a hat call out You get a hat! You can use this extra special tips that seem like magic.

"],["the-data-warhehouse-and-how-to-access-it.html", "Chapter 3 The Data Warhehouse and how to access it 3.1 The Data Warehouse 3.2 Accessing the data warehouse from R", " Chapter 3 The Data Warhehouse and how to access it The first section that follows provides lots of context about IDEA’s data warehouse. If, however, you are in a rush and want to go about accessing the data warehouse, then skip to section @ref(#accessing-the-data-warehouse-from-r) on accessing from R below. 3.1 The Data Warehouse The ‘data warehouse’ is actually a collection of disparate databases hosted by IDEA Public Schools. Some databases are used to host the original source data, some are used as the data model for production applications, while others site between those two points. While the IDEA has ~28 servers hosting SQL Server databases, R&amp;A typically only accesses 9 servers hosting 96 databases and 2,718 distinct tables. It’s a lot, for sure. 3.1.1 Core data warehouse server configuration The servers are not islands unto themselves, but rather form a small economy of data flows, where data moves from source servers, to production servers (i.e., the sweetspot for us) to reporting servers that host transformed data for our Logi-powered Locus dashboards. Figure 3.1: Data in the warehouse is initially stored in ‘src_` databases in ’DS’ servers and flows to the right towads Logi hosted Locus dashboards. Figure 3.1 shows the flows of data in the warehouse, which essentially move from left to right. TheDS-* servers host databases holding source data. That data is processed and saved in databases in the two production servers (PROD1 and PROD2). These two production servers host most the data that R&amp;A uses in analysis, but know where the source data comes from in is often helpful. Some data is (ostensibly) snapshotted and stored in the two *-HIS servers. To be sure, as of March 2020, R&amp;A doesn’t know much about these servers. The reporting servers—RS1, RS2, and RS-HIS, serve transformed flat files that serve as the data layer for Logi, which serves up Locus dashboards on the hub. The following sections provide some details on the what databases might be found on each server. 3.1.1.1 DS Servers NOTE: the DS servers have names that do not correspond the the servers’ URLS. Why this is the case is not clear, but this is something to pay attention to when work with data from these sources DS-PS is hosted on 887192-SQLDS and serves as a source for PROD1. Most the data hosted on DS-PS mirror PowerSchool’s Oracle back-end (espececially the Schools, ADA, and Enrollment databases), but it also has data from Teams Insights, staffing, college applications and outcomes, student persistence, among other things. Databases: ADA Attendance BlendedLearning CNP Colleges Enrollment Finance Insights: data from Microsoft Teams Persistence Schools: key data from PowerSchool Schools.DL Staffing Survey Sources: PowerSchool Other undefined sources Targets: Prod1 DS-III is hosted on 1044407-SQLDS2 and serves as a source for PROD2. (note that this is a bit confusing . . . which makes this writer think we may have this wrong; why would something called DS-III have server named DS2 that mostly provides source data to PROD2?) The data hosted on DS-III is almost exclusively source data from testing platforms like Illuminate DnA, AP, IB, ACT, and SAT. Databases: SRC_IA SRC_IB SRC_AP SRC_LEAP SRC_EA SRC_Dibles SRC_NWEA SRC_Plan SRC_SAT SRC_Telpas SRC_ACT SRC_Explorer Sources: See the database names just above PROD1 for lookup data about students and schools Targets: Prod2 DS-OT is hosted on 964592-SQLDS and serves as a source for PROD1. Databases focus on source data from variance external systems, including Naviance, Tyler Munis, Teachboost, Schoolmint, and a slew if individualized learning/blended learing platforms. Databases: SRC_Zendesk SRC_Naviance SRC_StMath SRC_DreamBox SRC_IHT SRC_TylerMunis SRC_TeachBoost SRC_StaffRetention SRC_SchoolMint SRC_Recruitment SRC_OpsCampusRanking SRC_JobVite SRC_HR SRC_GetRating SRC_ConnerStoneEvaluations SRC_BlendedLearning IdeaInstructionReporting Sources: See the database names just above PROD1 for lookup data about students and schools Targets: Prod1 3.1.1.2 PROD Servers PROD1 is hosted on 1065574-SQLPRD1 and contains a variety of data bases sourced from DS-PS and DS-OT. The key studetns, schools, and regions data is found here and is infact used by DS-III and DS-OT. Microsoft Insights data is now found here as well. This is the where transformed data is stored that is moved to RS2 (again, it is not clear why the server number doesn’t quite line up as we move from initial DS to PROD to RS). Databases: ADA Attendance BlendedLearning CNP Colleges Enrollment Finance Insights: data from Microsoft Teams Persistence Schools: key data from PowerSchool Schools.DL Staffing Survey Sources: DS-PS DS-OT Targets: RS2 ST-HIS FO1 PROD2 hosts all other data that is not on PROD, which is to say data initially stored in DS-III. This is the source server for RS1 and includes assessments (e.g., IAs, bi-weekly and unit assessments, AP, IB) data and accountability tables. Databases: Assessments Schools : this actually contains data \"inventories at the school level, like lists of employees, equipment and asset inventories, students schedules, correspondences between teachers and students. 3.1.1.3 RS and Hisotrical data Servers R&amp;A tends not to use these tables very often. RS1, RS2, and RS-HIS all have flat tables that utilized by by Logi for Locus Dashboards that are developed by Software Development. ST-HIS ostensibly has snapshots of data from the PROD servers, but that is just an unverified hunch ST-HIS Databases: unknown Sources: PROD1 PROD2 something called ST1 and ST2`? Targets RS-HIS RS1 Databases: unknown Sources: PROD2 something called ST2? Targets Logi RS2 Databases: unknown Sources: PROD1 something called ST1? Targets Logi RS-HIS Databases: unknown Sources: ST-HIS Targets Logi 3.1.2 Server, Table, and Field Lookup Table 3.2 provides details on servers, databases, tables, and fields. While it is not complete, it does cover the majority of our data infrastucture. Figure 3.2: Data warehouse details 3.1.2.1 IP Addresses of current servers For the fastest performance when working remotely it is best to directly access a database by using the IP address of the server rather than than the URL, which often has multiple hops over the network when resolving the DSN. Here’s a list of known IP Addresses and server names.

That means it works with dplyr verbs and functions, but what happens in the background is that dplyr and dbplyr generate SQL that is sent to the database you are connected to and all that computation (e.g., filtering, selecting, joining, calculations, aggregation) are completed on the remote SQL Server instance and not on your computer. Nevertheless, you will eventually want to pull that data down onto your machine when you want to use R or Python do what they can do (like modeling or graphics) that the database can’t do. Pulling that data down is easy with [dplyr::collect()] library(dplyr) schools_df &lt;- schools %&gt;% collect() %&gt;% janitor::clean_names() (Here janitor::clean_names() snake_cases all the column names). 3.2.2.1 What if I am pulling down lots of data (say, millions of rows)? In this instance the database connection may fail. It’s not ideal, but it happens. One way to deal with this is to pull down the data piecemeal. The collector() function in ideadata makes this task trivial. It takes column names as arguments (unquote) from the table you want to pull down and those columns are used to break up the data into smaller sets of data that are pulled down from the database onto your computer and then recombined into a single table. schools_df &lt;- schools %&gt;% collector(SchoolState, CountyName) %&gt;% janitor::clean_names() The ideadata package is clever in that it updates its knowledge of the data warehouse every time you load the package with library(ideadata). However to do that you need to have access to the the warehouse, and that requires that you are on the VPN/behind the firewall. Do makes sure that is true before invoking the package! 3.2.3 Where to learn more ideadata has it’s own documentation here. If you can’t find an answer there, then reach out to Chris Haid (he’s responsible for this craziness). Go to this article to set up your credentials in R so that the warehouse can authenticate and authorize you as verified user "],["projects.html", "Chapter 4 Projects 4.1 Version control with Github 4.2 Project Process 4.3 ProjectTemplate (for analyses) 4.4 The renv package: Ensuring reproducibility", " Chapter 4 Projects Some significant applications are demonstrated in this chapter. 4.1 Version control with Github All analysis projects need to be saved via Git (on your local computer) and pushed to Github. Doing so has several benefits to both you, to your future self, and to your teammates: Since Git is a version control system, you get to save and track changes in your work (data, source code, reports, PowerPoint decks, Shiny dashboards) incrementally. Incremental saving means you can recover from any accidental plunders. It’s like Track Changes in Word, but for multiple files and folders. Spill a Diet Coke on your laptop in the middle of a big analysis? No big deal (if you’ve been pushing commits to Github, it’ll all be there!) Collaboration is much more structured, with powerful tools for asynchronous work and managing versions. Referencing and reviewing code, tracking issues, and sharing what you’ve done is seamless, which means … Your work will be reproducible: anyone from R&amp;A can pull your repo from Github, run your analyses, add to or edit what you’ve done, and share those changes back in a way that is communicative and documented. setting up web documentation for any R packages you build become seamless. But enough on the why let’s get to how (if you do want to know more on the why, check out this excellent article by Jenny Bryan) 4.1.1 Getting Started with Git, Github, and RStudio Here’s a quick overview of what you’ll need to do, with details to follow: Dedicate a directory (a.k.a “folder”) to it. Make it an RStudio Project. Make it a Git repository. Go about your usual business. But instead of only saving individual files, periodically you make a commit, which takes a multi-file snapshot of the entire project. Push commits to GitHub periodically. This is like sharing a document with colleagues on OneDrive or DropBox or sending it out as an email attachment. 4.1.1.1 First steps These steps are borrowed with some light editing from Happy git with R by Jenny Bryan. Register for GitHub account. Install or update R and RStudio Install Git Those on Windows will want to do these steps as well Introduce yourself to Git. Prove local Git can talk to GitHub. Cache your username and password so you don’t need to authenticate yourself to GitHub interactively ad nauseum. Create and save a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT). Prove RStudio can find local Git and, therefore, can talk to GitHub. 4.1.2 Feature Branch Worklow There are many workflows using Git and remote repositories like Github. All of thenm boil down to the following steps: Pull or fetch or clone a repo on Github to your local machine. If you are starting a new project, then you’ll need to create a new repo on Github (but you can also start one on your machine). This is usually called the main (formerly master) branch. Create a new branch that you will work on. Do some analysis, coding, writing. Periodically save a snapshot of your entire project (all the files and folders, except those that you explicitly ignore). This is called *committing changes**. Every once ins while push your commits to the remote repo. Congrats! You’ve just backed up your remotely and made it easy to share. Merge your new analysis and code back into the main branch. This is usually initiated by something called a pull request (which is admittedly a little confusing). The specific workflow we use on IDEA’s R&amp;A team is the Feature Branch workflow, which has the benefit of being both simple, while minimizing merge conflicts. The core idea behind the Feature Branch Workflow is that all feature development should take place in a dedicated branch instead of the main branch. This encapsulation makes it easy for multiple analysts to work on a particular analysis without disturbing the main codebase. It also means the main branch will never contain broken code. Moreover, it means you’ll be more likely to get a second or third set of eyes on our analysis. This makes your work more transparent, helps enforce coding standards, and helps spread all the cool new techniques you’ve implemented in your analysis. So what does this look like? Well, here’s a picture of the feature branch workflow in use for this manual: This picture shows the development of this manual over time (from left to right) as rendered by Github’s network diagram: it includes new branches being created, commits being made and merges back into the main branch. The black line is the main branch and includes the most up-to-date, “official” version of this book. The green and blue lines are feature branches, which diverge from the main when you checkout a new branch. The dots represent commits. Colored lines returning to the main branch indicate a merge: the new code is now part of of the main branch. You might be wondering what the unmerged yellow line labeld gh-page represents. That is a special branch that is used by Githbub Actions that uses the concept of continuous integration/continuous to build the website that hosts this manual. You don’t need to worry about that one; it’s simply used to build out the site magically. 4.1.3 Example worflow with this manual, or getting your feet wet This section is going to walk you through how to use git/github by updating this manual. You’ll (i) clone the Github repo locally on your laptop, (ii) create a feature branch, (iii) make some changes to this documentation, save those changes, and then commit those changes git (i.e., locally take a snapshot), (iv) push those changes (including all of your commits) up to the Github repo, (v) initiate a pull request (i.e., ask to merge your branch into the main branch), and finally (vi) merge your changes into the master branch. But first things first: Verify you did the initial set-up steps above Get your bio ready **Note that throughout the steps below I’ll show you how to each step Ok. Your ready? Great! Here we go. 4.1.3.1 Get the R_and_A_Manual repository URL Go to R_and_A_Manual repo in your browser. On the main page for the repo click the green Code button, Click on HTTPS (the default), and click the clipboard to copy the repo’s URL: 4.1.3.2 Clone the repo Now you’ll pull the remote repo from Github onto you computer. You’ll want to think about where you want to save this. For example I save data analysis projects in seperate folders under a Data_Analysis/ folder. I save the manual just on my one drive. 4.1.3.2.1 Comand line Here I’m saving this to temporary space, by navigating to ~/tmp/~ and then cloning the data: cd ~/tmp/ git clone https://github.com/idea-analytics/r_and_a_manual.git This will pull down all the content of the repo: files, folders, all commits, all branches. Really the whole kit and kaboodle. 4.1.3.2.2 RStudio Here’s how you do it from RStudio: In RStudio, start a new Project: File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git, or click on project icon in the upper right-hand corner of the IDE and select New Project…. In the “repository URL” paste the URL of your new GitHub repository. That is: https://github.com/idea-analytics/r_and_a_manual.git Be intentional about where you create this project. You should click “Open in new session”. Click Create Project to create a new directory, which will be all of these things: a directory or “folder” on your computer a Git repository, linked to the remote GitHub repository an RStudio Project Cool. You should now have the R&amp;A Manual files on repo history on your computer! 4.1.3.3 Checkout a branch Before you start doing anything you should check out a branch. A branch is like your own, tempory, disposable workspace. When you checkout a branch you create a new copy of the the repo and changes you make only happen on the branch. When your happy with the changes and are ready to share them you’ll to a pull request. But we’ll get to that below. 4.1.3.3.1 Command line It’s pretty straightforward. You create the branch, by giving a short but meaningful name, and then check it out. git branch update-bio-cjh git checkout update-bio-cjh Or you can do both of those moves in one line by using git checkout with the -b flag: git checkout -b update-bio-cjh 4.1.3.3.2 RStudio Click on the Git panel (usually in the upper right on that standard RStudio layout, but YMMV if you’ve customized your layouts). Click on the purple “branch” icon (it kinda looks like a piece of a flowchart). Giving a short but meaningful name (something like, update-bio-cjh). Make sure the Sync branch with remote checkbox is selected; this will save you a step later when you push you changes up to the repo. 4.1.3.4 Making changes and saving them You now on a new branch and go go makes some changes. Go ahead and open 02-Who_We_Are.Rmd file and add your name as a section, update your bio and save it, as you usually would Now you’ll want to commit those changes, which takes a snapshot of the current state on the branch you are working on. 4.1.3.5 Command line after saving you’ll run the git commit command with the -a (adds all changes) and -m (add commit message) flag with a short description of what you did. git commit -a -m &quot;Updated Chris&#39;s bio&quot; You should do this often. After a while you’ll want to push your changes up to Github (frequently, but not as often as commits): git push You’ve likely not yet defined where this remote branch should go, but git will give you a helpful error which gives you the command for syncing your local branch with a new remote branch.: fatal: The current branch update-bio-cjh has no upstream branch. To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use git push --set-upstream origin update-bio-cjh Go ahead and copy and run that command. git push --set-upstream origin update-bio-cjh After that you can just use git push and you’ll branch changes will be saved remotely. 4.1.3.6 Maintaining large files If you have a file that is over 100 MB in size (e.g. a PowerBI dashboard), GitHub will block your commit (or at least send you a warning). There are two ways of approaching this issue: Use the large file storage (LFS) extension to commit the file. Add the file to .gitignore so the file is not committed. 4.1.3.6.1 Large file storage (LFS) Scenario: Suppose you have a PowerBI file Persistence_Dashboard.pbix that is 137 MB in size, so it cannot be handled through normal a Git workflow. You will need to download the LFS extension from this site: https://git-lfs.github.com/. Once you download, then you will follow these steps: Open the Git command line. (I have not found a solution through RStudio or GitHub Desktop). Switch to the repo and branch that has the large file. Install the LFS extension in the correct repo and branch using git lfs install Track the file extension (in our scenario, .pbix), using git lfs track &quot;*.pbix&quot; Track .gitattributes. git add .gitattributes N.B. Do not complete steps 3, 4, and 5 until after you have switched to the correct repo and branch. 6. Commit the file and push normally. When you commit, you will see a message indicating the LFS extension was used on that file. 4.1.3.6.2 Using .gitignore Alternatively, you could choose not to commit the file and just keep the large file locally. (This is a good option if the file can be generated through code, like a .csv output). You will follow these steps: If the file does not already exist, create a text file called .gitignore in your repo. Add the name of the file you wish to ignore in the .gitignore file (e.g. .Rdata is ignored when using ProjectTemplate). Save .gitignore and commit. 4.1.3.7 RStudio In your git panel you see changed (or new) files show up. You’ll want to select the check box for any file that’s been modified (indicated by an M) or that needs to be added (indicated by an A). Doing so readies the file to be updated in the commit: Click the commit button and new dialog box will open, which will show any changes you’ve made in an y file. Select the check box for staged, if isn’t already selected, add a commit message and click Commit When your ready to save those to the repo, simply press the Push button. 4.1.3.8 Merging changes. Merging changes in your feature branch with the main branch requires you go to Github and to a pull request. A pull request is essential asking the main branch to “pull” in your changes and is technically known as a merge.. So here are the steps. Go to the repo (https://github.com/idea-analytics/r_and_a_manual). You may see an info box suggesting you can merge your branch. If so, click on the Compare &amp; pull request button. If not select your branch and click the Pull Request icon. If you are able to merge (you’ll know) click the Create pull request button. Ask someone to review you request (ideally) Click the Merge pull request button and confirm the merge. If you are done with our feature branch feel free to delete it. You done! You’ll want to be careful here if you are working with others. If you pulled your main branch down a while ago there is a risk that the main branch on your laptop is not up-to-date with the main branch on Github (because others have merged changes there). The best remedy is to checkout and pull main—which gets up to date—and then checkout your branch and run git merge main. You may have to resolve conflicts. 4.2 Project Process Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, in, et sed facilisi maximus suspendisse, facilisi in.

Simply put, it’s a package that builds the scaffolding for a project, provides good features for tracking package dependencies (though we also use renv for that), and separating data loading and prep from analysis and output, as well as caching of long running processes, which speeds up analytical time. Is it perfect? No. It has more features than we’ll likely ever use (logging, code profiling, and unit testing). IF you are new to ProjectTemplate the Getting Started Tutorial is great. Indeed, it’s always good to read the docs Seriously, though. The ProjectTemplate documentation is great and you should really set aside an hour to read through it. This manual will provide a very abbreviated overview of how to use ProjectTemplate at IDEA, but will not be a stand in for the official documentation. 4.3.1 Installing ProjectTemplate Installing the package is straightforward install.packages(&quot;ProjectTemplate&quot;) 4.3.2 Creating a project with ProjectTemplate Creating a project is pretty simple. Navigate to where you typically save projects vai RStudio and then run the following commands library(ProjectTemplate) create.project(&quot;learning-pt&quot;) Doing that bestows upon you the following directory structure: ProjectTemplate Directory Structure You’ll notice in the image above that there is .Rproj file, which isn’t added by ProjectTemplate. I created an Project in RStudio first and then navigated to that direction and ran the following create.project(\"../learning-pt/\", merge.strategy = \"allow.non.conflict\"), which allows you to scaffold ProjectTemplate in an existing directory while ignoring any existing files and folders (usually *.Rproj and .git). 4.3.3 What goes where We only use about half of the directories that ProjectTemplate Scaffolds. Here’s what we use ,in the order it’s evaluated by ProjectTemplate when you run load.project(): config This directory contains the configuration file global.dcf. This is the first thing that load.project() looks at. The fill list of what each setting does is here. Here are a few highlights, in thier order of importance. load_libraries: This can be set to ‘on’ or ‘off’. If load_libraries is on, the system will load all of the R packages listed in the libraries field described below. By default, load_libraries is off. I highly recommend that you turn this on ‘libraries’: This is a comma separated list of all the R packages that the user wants to automatically load when load.project() is called. These packages must already be installed before calling load.project(). By default, the reshape2, plyr, tidyverse, stringr and lubridate packages are included in this list. I recommend dropping these and only adding packages you are using for the project. data_loading: This can be set to ‘on’ or ‘off’. If data_loading is on, the system will load data from both the cache and data directories with cache taking precedence in the case of name conflict. By default, data_loading is on. cache_loading: This can be set to ‘on’ or ‘off’. If cache_loading is on, the system will load data from the cache directory before any attempt to load from the data directory. By default, cache_loading is on. munging: This can be set to ‘on’ or ‘off’. If munging is on, the system will execute the files in the munge directory sequentially using the order implied by the sort() function. If munging is off, none of the files in the munge directory will be executed. By default, munging is on. as_factors: This can be set to ‘on’ or ‘off’. If as_factors is on, the system will convert every character vector into a factor when creating data frames; most importantly, this automatic conversion occurs when reading in data automatically. If ‘off’, character vectors will remain character vectors. By default, as_factors is off. *This is a very good default, and the opposite of base R. lib: this directory is used to house helper functions. You can store them in an *.R file (like the included helpers.R file). ** As a general rule of thumb, if you’ve copied-and-pasted a block of code twice, don’t do it a third time; rather, abstract that block into a function and save it in this directory. load.project sources the files in this directory after readying global.dcf. cache: Here you’ll store any data sets that (i) are generated during a preprocessing step and (ii) don’t need to be regenerated every single time you analyze your data. You can use the cache() function to store data to this directory automatically. Any data set found in both the cache and data directories will be drawn from cache instead of data based on ProjectTemplate’s priority rules. ProjectTemplate always checks this before running code in the data/ and munge/. directories. You can learn more about caching here. data: You store your raw data files here. If they are encoded in a supported file format, they’ll automatically be loaded when you call load.project(), *unless cached versions of their output exist in the cache/ directory. munge: Here you can store any preprocessing or “data munging” code for your project. For example, if you need to add columns at runtime, merge normalized data set,s or globally censor any data points, that code should be stored in the munge directory. The preprocessing scripts stored in munge will be executed in alphabetical order when you call load.project(), so you should prepend numbers (to digit like 01-aggregate_schools, 02-calc-means, …) to the filenames to indicate their sequential order.. Files in here are run after those in cache/ and data/ are loaded. reports: Here you can store any output reports, especially RMarkdown reports, that you produce. This is where final reports live ProjectTemplate doesn’t always play well with RMarkdown (well, really the issue is with knitr. The biggest issue is running load.project() inside of RMarkdown. ProjectTemplate will complain that your reports/ directory is not a ProjectTemplate directory, which is annoying. It’s easily fixed with this line of code at the top of your RMarkdown and you are in Rproject: setwd(here::here()); load.project() This will change the working directory to the top of project and then run load.project. After the project is loaded knitr will set the working directory back to reports/, so all other file references should be relative to reports/ src: Here you’ll store your statistical analysis and mahcine scripts. You should add the following piece of code to the start of each analysis script: library('ProjectTemplate); load.project() (you don’t need the tip above here). You should also do your best to ensure that any code that’s shared between the analyses in src is moved into the munge directory; if you do that, you can execute all of the analyses in the src directory in parallel. A future release of ProjectTemplate will provide tools to automatically execute every individual analysis from src in parallel. You may want to cache() your results here as well. graphs: Here you can store any graphs or PowerPoints that you produce, with the exception of those already contained in RMarkdown files. 4.4 The renv package: Ensuring reproducibility The renv package goes a long way to solving a pernicious problem: Dependency Hell. Here’s a good description of the problem: This problem most manifest when you revisit a recurring project a year later. You updated some year variables in your code and rerun your code and ready to pat yourself on the back and then BAM! Your code breaks. It breaks because over the previous 12 months the packages you relied upon a year ago have been updated over time and don’t work with other packages. Sometimes all you need to to is update all of your packages and everything is hunky-dory; but other times this brute force process doesn’t work. You are left trying to understand whats changed over multiple packages, what your need to change in your code and something you thought would take you an hour takes a a week, with most days feeling like your just banging your heard against the wall. This issues alone should be enough to convince you that your need to create reproducible environments. Another reason is related and often very immediate: working on the same analysis with someone else. Perhaps you are are fastidious and only use the most current version of every package and your partner is risk averse and only updates packages after they’ve been out in the wild for at least a year. If you are in this boat your going to have problems. Again, you need to create reproducible environments. This is a common technique in Python and there it goes by the name of virtual environments. renv is an R implementation of the concept that is pretty elegant Along with ProjectTemplate we use the renv package to ensure that our analysis projects are: Isolated: Each project gets its own library of R packages, so you can feel free to upgrade and change package versions in one project without worrying about breaking your other projects. Portable: Because renv captures the state of your R packages within a lockfile, you can more easily share and collaborate on projects with others, and ensure that everyone is working from a common base. Reproducible: Use renv::snapshot() to save the state of your R library to the lockfile renv.lock. You can later use renv::restore() to restore your R library exactly as specified in the lockfile. These three points are crucial for working well with others and protection your future self. As usual, you really should read the docs for renv. They are thorough and clear. There’s also an excellent FAQ 4.4.1 Setting up renv with a new project If you are starting a new project in RStudio then setting up renv is easy: just be sure to click the Use renv with this project. Definition of dependency hell Checking that box will add the bootstrap renv, installing the package if necessary as well as a few folders and files that serve as infrastructure 4.4.2 Setting up renv with an existing project If you’ve got a project that you want to starting using renv it’s pretty straightforward:. Install renv if you don’t have it: install.packages('renv') Use renv::init() to initialize a project. renv will discover the R packages used in your project, and install those packages into a private project library. It’s really that simple! 4.4.3 Using renv The renv workflow is super, duper simple, after you’ve set it up: Work in your project as usual, installing and upgrading R packages as required as your project evolves. Use renv::snapshot() to save the state of your project library. The project state will be serialized into a file called renv.lock. If you want to revert to the previous state of your project—i.e., you installed a new version of a package and it’s wreaking havoc on your project—simply use renv::restore(). Following these simple steps isolates your projects environment from the rest of your other projects. So downloading a bleeding-edge, dev version of package from GitHub b/c you need a new feature won’t pollute your other projects that are running just fine. This is the isolation bit mentioned in the three points above 4.4.4 Collaborating with renv The renv developers recommend the following steps when using renv in collaborative settings Use a git/GitHub repo. One user should explicitly initialize renv in the project, via renv::init() or when starting an RStudio project. Doing so will create the initial renv lockfile, and also write the renv auto-loaders to the project’s .Rprofile and renv/activate.R. These will ensure the right version of renv is downloaded and installed for your collaborators when they start in this project. Share your project sources, alongside the generated lockfile renv.lock via GitHub. Be sure to also share the generated auto-loaders in .Rprofile and renv/activate.R via the repo. When a collaborator first launches in this project, renv should automatically bootstrap itself, thereby downloading and installing the appropriate version of renv into the project library. After this has completed, they can then use renv::restore() to restore the project library locally on their machine. While working on a project, you or your collaborators may need to update or install new packages in your project. When this occurs, you’ll also want to ensure your collaborators are then using the same newly-installed packages. In general, the process looks like this: A user installs, or updates, one or more packages in their local project library; That user calls renv::snapshot() to update the renv.lock lockfile; That user then shares the updated version of renv.lock with their collaborators via github; Other collaborators then—after a git pull—call renv::restore() to install the packages specified in the newly-updated lockfile. A bit of care is required if collaborators wish to update the shared renv.lock lockfile concurrently – in particular, if multiple collaborators are installing new packages and updating their own local copy of the lockfile, then conflicts would need to be sorted out afterwards. Use teams to ensure any changes to renv.lock are communicated so that everyone knows and understands when and why packages have been installed or updated. For more information on collaboration strategies, please visit environments.rstudio.com. 4.4.5 renv and RStudio Connect In short there should be no issues, but there is one important thing to always keep in mind when publishing to RStudio connect: The renv generated .Rprofile file should not be included in deployments to RStudio Connect. ###Specific Projects ##Teacher Hiring Jobvite Data *Obtained from HA team. It is the data from the candidates who apply for IDEA jobs through Jobvite. Not all candidates applied through Jobvite in the past, but HA is trying to streamline the application process and require all applicants for all jobs (at all campuses) to apply through a central system, which is Jobvite. A particular Jobvite file is labeled with a year, such as “Jobvite 19-20”, and it will have column “Candidate Submit Date”, which is a range from October 2019 to July 2019 (October to July, proceeding the year the applicant will likely begin work). An applicant from that range will most likely have a Start Date of August 2019 (or sometime in the calendar year 2019, starting AFTER the 19-20 Academic Year). However, there are cases when applicants will, for example, apply during the 10/2018 - 07/2019 cycle (Jobvite 19-20), but will not have a Start Date until 2020 or 2021 (so they do not start the following FAll after the application cycle). This data has columns including Candidate Full Name, Candidate Email (personal email used for the application), and some of the pre-hire selection measures, such as GPA. However, all 5 of the pre-hire selection measures are not included yet (Stem Major, Teach For America status, Experience prior to IDEA, GPA, and Teacher Certification). The data also has no Employee IDs yet, as this is a list of candidates. There is a Hire Yes/No column, which has “Yes” for those candidates who were offered a position and “No” for those who were not offered a position. Also, there is a Requisition ID which is basically an application ID number, and it is unique per application. If a single candidate applies for more than one position, the candidate will have a unique ID for each application.

It contains historical student personal data since IDEA’s inception. We use this table to know to what subpopulation a student belongs to. Also, we can link this table to other student data using the [StudentNumber] field. Table: [1065574-SQLPRD1].[PROD1].[Schools].[Students] Main fields: [AcademicYear] [StudentNumber] | [SchoolNumber] | [GradeLevelID] | [EnrollmentStatus] | [Gender] | [SPED] | [ELLCode] | [PrimaryDisabilityCode ] | [SecondaryDisabilityCode ] | [TertiaryDisabilityCode ] | [EconomicDisadvantageCode] | [FederalHispanicFlag] | [FederaRaceI] | [FederaRaceA] | [FederaRaceB] | [FederaRaceP] | [FederaRaceW] |[EntryDate] | [ExitDate] | [RowIsCurrent] Who is what?: [EnrollmentStatus]: If EnrollmentStatus = 0, it means that the student is/was an active student for the corresponding academic year, If EnrollmentStatus = 2, it means the student left the district before completing the academic year, If EnrollmentStatus = 3, it means the student graduated from IDEA’s high school. [ELLCode]: English Learner (EL) A.K.A. Limited English Proficiency (LEP) If ELLCode = 0, student is not identified as an EL student, If ELLCode = 1, the student is identified as an EL student, If ELLCode not in (0,1), it means the student is not currently identified as an EL but was identified before as one, If ELLCode = “F”, the student is not identified as an EL student but is in the First Year of Monitoring status, IF ELLCode = “S”, the student is not identified as an EL student but is in the Second Year of Monitoring status, If ELLCode = 3, the student is not identified as an EL student but is in the Third Year of Monitoring status, If ELLCode = 4, the student is not identified as an EL student but is in the Fourth Year of Monitoring status, If ELLCode = 5, the student is not identified as an EL student but was at one point more than 4 years ago. EL Reclassification An EL who has passed the Texas English Language Proficiency Assessment System (TELPAS) will be reclassified as a Non-EL and monitored for 4 years. After reclassification the students ELLCode will not change to 0, it will move through the codes for the 4 years of monitoring status and then change to an ELLCode of 5 [SPED]: SPED students are composed of RISE and Life Skills students, not including Critical Student Intervention (CSI) students. If SPED = 0, it means the student is not identified as a SPED student, otherwise then SPED = 1. [InstructionalSettingCode]: Students who are classified as SPED may receive additional services. Their services can be found in the InstructionalSettingDescription column, which is linked to a specific PEIMS code: InstructionalSettingCode Description 0 No additional SPED services 1 Homebound 40 Mainstream 41 Resource Room/Services &lt; 21% 42 Resource Room/Services 21- &lt;50% 43 Resource Room/Services 50- 60% 44 Resource Room/Services &gt; 60% If InstructionalSettingCode = 43 or 44, the student is typically in RISE. [DisabilityCode] DisabilityCode Description 0 No disability 1 Orthopedic impairment 2 Other health impairment 3 Auditory impairment 4 Visual impairment 5 Deaf-Blind 6 Intellectual Disability 7 Emotional disturbance 8 Learning disability 9 Speech impairment 10 Autism 13 Traumatic brain injury 14 Noncategorical early childhood SELECT DISTINCT [StudentNumber], [PrimaryDisabilityCode] AS [DisabilityCode], [PrimaryDisabilityDescription] AS [DisabilityDescription] FROM ( SELECT DISTINCT [StudentNumber],[PrimaryDisabilityCode], [PrimaryDisabilityDescription] FROM [PROD1].[Schools].[Students] WHERE AcademicYear=&#39;2018-2019&#39; UNION ALL SELECT DISTINCT [StudentNumber], [SecondaryDisabilityCode], [SecondaryDisabilityDescription] FROM [PROD1].[Schools].[Students] WHERE AcademicYear=&#39;2018-2019&#39; UNION ALL SELECT DISTINCT [StudentNumber], [TertiaryDisabilityCode], [TertiaryDisabilityDescription] FROM [PROD1].[Schools].[Students] WHERE AcademicYear=&#39;2018-2019&#39;) A WHERE [PrimaryDisabilityDescription] &lt;&gt; &#39;&#39; ORDER BY StudentNumber [EconomicDisadvantageCode]: A.K.A ECD If EconomicDisadvantageCode = 0, then the student is not identified as economically disadvantaged, otherwise the student is identified as economically disadvantaged, If EconomicDisadvantageCode = 1, then the student is identified as an economically disadvantaged and eligible for free meals, If EconomicDisadvantageCode = 2, the student is also identified as an economically disadvantaged but only eligible for reduced-price meals, If EconomicDisadvantageCode = 99, it means the student is identified as an economically disadvantaged one but has another economic disadvantage. ECDFlag Consolidates the codes above to 0/1 indicator If ECDFlag = TRUE (1), the student is identified as economically disadvantaged, If ECDFlag = FALSE (0), the student is not identified as economically disadvantaged. Race / Ethnicity: Same like in TX If the student identifies as Hispanic or Latino then the student is classified as Hispanic/Latino, If the student does not identify as Hispanic or Latino and only selected one race the student is classified as that race, If the student does not identify as Hispanic or Latino and selected more than one race, then the student is classified as Two or more races. [RowIsCurrent]: Indicates the most current row for a student, Only to be used on the current school year 7.1.1 Common queries We frequently need to disaggregate data by year, region, school, and so on, while retaining basic information about a student. The Students table does not directly contain the school or region names, so we need to join the Schools table and Regions table. For example, the following are two queries to pull currently enrolled seniors: SQL example: SELECT [AcademicYear] ,C.[RegionDescription] ,B.[SchoolName] ,[GradeLevelID] ,[StudentNumber] ,[StudentFullName] ,[FirstName] ,[MiddleInitial] ,[LastName] #join Schools and Regions tables FROM [1065574-SQLPRD1].[PROD1].[Schools].[Students] AS A LEFT JOIN [1065574-SQLPRD1].[PROD1].[Schools].[Schools] AS B ON A.[SchoolNumber] = B.[SchoolNumber] INNER JOIN [1065574-SQLPRD1].[PROD1].[Schools].[Regions] AS C ON B.[RegionID] = C.[RegionID] #filter for currently enrolled seniors in 2021-2022 WHERE [AcademicYear] = &#39;2021-2022&#39; AND [GradeLevelID] = &#39;12&#39; AND [ExitDate] &gt; &#39;2022-05-01&#39; AND [RowIsCurrent] = &#39;1&#39; R example: get_students() %&gt;% #filter for currently enrolled seniors in 2021-2022 filter(AcademicYear == &quot;2021-2022&quot;, GradeLevelID == &quot;12&quot;, ExitDate &gt; &quot;2022-05-01&quot;, RowIsCurrent == 1) %&gt;% #join Schools and Regions tables inner_join(get_schools(), by = c(&quot;SchoolNumber&quot; = &quot;SchoolNumber&quot;)) %&gt;% inner_join(get_regions(), by = c(&quot;RegionID&quot; = &quot;RegionID&quot;)) %&gt;% select(AcademicYear, RegionDescription, SchoolName, GradeLevelID, StudentNumber, StudentFullName, FirstName, MiddleInitial, LastName) 7.2 Student Persistence Student Persistence is one of the most important measures that Chiefs, VPs, and School Leaders are always monitoring to understand our efforts in providing high quality services to our students and families. In order for a student to actualize the benefits of IDEA the student must persist through high school. We say a student persisted if the student was enrolled and attended school for the entire academic school year, returned the following school year, and was enrolled and attending on the Monday after the first week of school (the First Day of Persistence FDOP). In other words, the student was enrolled and attended school on the “First Day of Persistence (FDOP)” for two consecutive years. The only exception to this are New Students that enroll after the FDOP, attend the entire year, return the following year, and are enrolled and attending for FDOP. These new students were not enrolled and attending for 2 consecutive FDOPs because they enrolled after the first FDOP but would be considered as persisting. Example: John enrolled in IDEA Public Schools on August 19, 2019, and attended school on FDOP, which is the Monday after the first week of school. John attended the entire 2019-2020 academic year and was enrolled and attending on the FDOP of the following academic year (FDOP for 2020-2021 school year). If John was enrolled but did not attend on FDOP because he didn’t return until September, John would not count as a student who persisted. Database: [1065574-SQLPRD1].[Persistence] Main metrics: District, Regional, School, Sub-population, Grade Level General Formula: 1 – (Leavers/All Students) Tables: [dbo].[PersistenceCode]: This table is used to calculate the persistence rate for the current academic year. The data is updated every three hours, weekdays. LeaverWeek column shows the week the student left the district (beginning the week containing the FDOP, which is the second week of the academic year)? After the end of the current school year but before the persistence year has ended (the summer months), the week the student leaves the district is captured in the ULeaverWeek column. The PersistenceWeek column shows the current week of persistence for the school and region that the student attends (this week will be different across schoools and regions due to differing start dates and FDOPs). [dbo].[PersistenceHistorical]: This table contains the final persistence data for previous persistence years starting with 2018-2019 and up through 2020-2021. This table is updated with the previous years’ data after that year is closed out and the next persistence year has started. Context: Who Counts? To calculate persistence, we need to filter out all students who should be excluded from the denominator, filter(EXCLUDE == 0, FDOPCOUNTP == 1). This limits the denominator to only those students that should be counted. These two filters should be used when looking at current or historical data. Who is a Leaver? All leavers are coded as FDOPLEAVER = 1, if FDOPLEAVER = 0 then they are a current student. Other Useful Fields: AcademicYear: the academic year RegionDescription: the region the student is in SchoolShortName: the school the student attends SchoolType: Academy of College Prep GradeLevelID: Student’s grade level (integer ranging from -1 = Pre-K to 12) NewStudent: indicates if the student is new (1) or returning (0) PersistenceWeek: the current week of persistence based on the student’s region and school (ranges from 1-52) LeaverWeek: the persistence week the student left the district ULeaverWeek: the persistence week the student left the district if it was after the last day of school PersistenceCode: the reason the student left the district PersistenceCategory: the category that the reason falls into for why the student left the district PersistenceComment: any additional comments the SIS clerk has for why the student left the district EnrollmentStatus: contains the enrollment status, but is not accurate Do Not Use EntryDate: the date the student entered school for a particular academic year or the date the student started school at a new campus ExitDate: the last day of the academic year (last day of school) or the day the student left the district (summer leavers are sometimes snapped back to the last day of school, beware) Recapture: 0/1 indicator of students that have left and then returned to the district. 1 = recaptured, 0 = not recaptured. Not to be Trusted SummerLeaver: 0/1 indicator for students that leave during the summer StudentGender: “M”/“F” gender indicator Race: race indicator combined with ethnicity; ex. “WHITE-HISPANIC” IsHispanic: indicates whether the student identifies as Hispanic; values = “HISPANIC” or “NON-HISPANIC” Migrant: 0/1 indicator of student’s migrant status LEP: 0/1 indicator of student’s English Learner status. Inaccurate Don’t Use Sped: 0/1 indicator of student’s SPED status EconDisad: 0/1 indicator of student’s economic disadvantaged status. Inaccurate Don’t Use IsCSI: 0/1 indicator for students identified as CSI ContinuousEnrollment: 0/1 indicates whether the student has been continuously enrolled 7.3 College Application &amp; Matriculation Metrics To close the opportunity gap, IDEA Public Schools is committed to a vision of College for All Children. The College Success Team (CST) lead the initiative of monitoring and identifying the best College/University for each senior student, this is possible with data dashboards that use Naviance information. Database: [1065574-SQLPRD1].[PROD1].[Colleges] Main metrics: Percent at least 1 application, Percent at least 1 submission, Percent at least 1 acceptance Most important columns: [Stage] | [ResultCode] Tables: [Colleges]: Here we will find all colleges/universities. What makes this table important is the [CEEB] field which is an ID that can help us connect distinct college related data sources like Naviance with National Student Clearinghouse data! [CollegeTuition]: Besides having in-state tuition and out-of-state tuition data, we can also find two other unique codes ([OPEID] and [ACTCode]), that will aid us to college data across different data sources. [EDocs]: Details about application submitted e-documents. [StudentCollegeApplication]: This is the main table. We use it to calculate most of the metrics the College Application &amp; Matriculation dashboard has. We can find data from 2018 up to the current academic year. [StudentCollegeApplicationsSummary]: [StudentScholarships]: Context: Who Counts? Who is a 4year 2year? Persistence Rate by: District: use all data Region: use the [RegionDescription] field School: [SchoolShortName] + [SchoolType] Grade Level: [GradeLevelID] Student Type (new or returning): use [NewStudent] = 1 to identify new students, if zero then the student is considered as a returning student. Other Useful Fields: Use [PersistenceCode] or [PersistenceCategory] to know student and family reasons on why a student left the district. [LeaverWeek] to know the week when the student left the district. SQL Code Example: SELECT 1 - AVG(CAST([FDOPLEAVER] AS NUMERIC)) FROM [`1065574-SQLPRD1`].[Persistence].[dbo].[PersistenceCode] WHERE [FDOPCOUNTP] = 1 7.4 Critical Student Intervention (CSI) Identification To address the achievement gap among students, Dolores Gonzalez, our Chief Program Office introduced the Critical Student Intervention (CSI) program in 2014. Currently, along with her team, Tricia Lopez our VP of Special Programs lead IDEA Public Schools in the effort of reducing the performance gaps. To help Tricia’s team, the Software Development team put together a table where we can find the students who are enrolled in a CSI math and/or reading intervention program. Database: [1065574-SQLPRD1].[PROD1].[Schools] Main metrics: Percent of CSI students by school Most important columns: [ProgramID] | [InterventionType] Tables: [StudentCSI]: This table will aid us to identify the students who are/were enrolled in math or reading CSI intervention programs. Since sometimes there is need of data adjustments from one year to another, the [ProgramID] number might change. However, this should not be a problem because we can always use the [InterventionType] field to correctly associate an intervention program to either math or reading. SQL Code Example: SELECT DISTINCT AcademicYear, [Subject], ProgramID FROM (SELECT [AcademicYear] ,[ProgramID] ,CASE WHEN [InterventionType] LIKE &#39;%math%&#39; THEN &#39;Math&#39; WHEN [InterventionType] LIKE &#39;%reading%&#39; THEN &#39;Reading&#39; ELSE NULL END AS [Subject] FROM [1065574-SQLPRD1].[PROD1].[Schools].[StudentCSI] WHERE [AcademicYear] = &#39;2018-2019&#39; AND (InterventionType LIKE &#39;%math%&#39; OR InterventionType LIKE &#39;%reading%&#39;)) AS A GROUP BY AcademicYear, [Subject], ProgramID [StudentCSIDetails]: Here we find detailed information about the students who are or were part of a CSI program. We can either use this table to get a student count per school, or we could match the [StudentCSI] table data to the Students table and get the percent of CSI students per school. SQL Code Example: SELECT A.StudentNumber, A.SchoolNumber, B.SchoolName, D.[Subject] FROM [1065574-SQLPRD1].[PROD1].[Schools].[Students] AS A INNER JOIN [1065574-SQLPRD1].[PROD1].[Schools].[Schools] AS B ON A.SchoolNumber = B.SchoolNumber LEFT JOIN [1065574-SQLPRD1].[PROD1].[Schools].[StudentCSI] AS C ON A.StudentNumber = C.StudentNumber AND A.AcademicYear = C.AcademicYear LEFT JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT AcademicYear, [Subject], ProgramID FROM (SELECT [AcademicYear] ,[ProgramID] ,CASE WHEN [InterventionType] LIKE &#39;%math%&#39; THEN &#39;Math&#39; WHEN [InterventionType] LIKE &#39;%reading%&#39; THEN &#39;Reading&#39; ELSE NULL END AS [Subject] FROM [1065574-SQLPRD1].[PROD1].[Schools].[StudentCSI] WHERE [AcademicYear] = &#39;2020-2021&#39; AND (InterventionType LIKE &#39;%math%&#39; OR InterventionType LIKE &#39;%reading%&#39;)) AS A GROUP BY AcademicYear, [Subject], ProgramID) AS D ON C.ProgramID = D.ProgramID WHERE A.AcademicYear = &#39;2020-2021&#39; ###Specific Projects ##Teacher Hiring Jobvite Data *Obtained from HA team. It is the data from the candidates who apply for IDEA jobs through Jobvite. Not all candidates applied through Jobvite in the past, but HA is trying to streamline the application process and require all applicants for all jobs (at all campuses) to apply through a central system, which is Jobvite. A particular Jobvite file is labeled with a year, such as “Jobvite 19-20”, and it will have column “Candidate Submit Date”, which is a range from October 2019 to July 2019 (October to July, proceeding the year the applicant will likely begin work). An applicant from that range will most likely have a Start Date of August 2019 (or sometime in the calendar year 2019, starting AFTER the 19-20 Academic Year). However, there are cases when applicants will, for example, apply during the 10/2018 - 07/2019 cycle (Jobvite 19-20), but will not have a Start Date until 2020 or 2021 (so they do not start the following FAll after the application cycle). This data has columns including Candidate Full Name, Candidate Email (personal email used for the application), and some of the pre-hire selection measures, such as GPA. However, all 5 of the pre-hire selection measures are not included yet (Stem Major, Teach For America status, Experience prior to IDEA, GPA, and Teacher Certification). The data also has no Employee IDs yet, as this is a list of candidates. There is a Hire Yes/No column, which has “Yes” for those candidates who were offered a position and “No” for those who were not offered a position. Also, there is a Requisition ID which is basically an application ID number, and it is unique per application. If a single candidate applies for more than one position, the candidate will have a unique ID for each application.

In consultation with our stakeholders, we carefully select the most relevant approach(es) to provide an appropriate and accurate product. We use methods in descriptive, inferential, and predictive statistics to understand information about our organization. However, the design of the program influences how we establish our methods of research. 8.1 Research design When our works requires us to assign causation, we must consider how the data were collected before deciding on an appropriate model. 8.1.1 Causal inference Most of our data is observational, so if we want to describe causal relationships in our data, we must appeal to potential outcomes. Thus, we will briefly cover some of relevant causal inference concepts and techniques. When a student is marked for inclusion in, say, a tutorial group, we would like to see how much the tutorial increased their score on a test, compared to a scenario where the student did not attend the tutorial. If the student attends the tutorial, we can measure the outcome of the treatment (the tutorial) by seeing what grade they earned after a test; we cannot observe, however, the outcome of the control (no tutorial). Potential outcomes aims to remedy this. 8.1.1.1 Potential outcomes Suppose we have both the treatment and control outcomes for each student. We would like to measure \\(\\delta_i = Y^1_i - Y^0_i\\), the difference in the treatment outcome \\(Y^1_i\\) and control outcome \\(Y^0_i\\) for student \\(i\\). Then, our main estimators for the tutorial effect are \\(ATE, ATT\\) and \\(ATU\\), which are defined below: \\(ATE = E[\\delta_i]\\) represents the Average Treatment Effect \\(E[\\delta_i] = E[Y^1_i - Y^0_i]\\). In other words, \\(ATE\\) answers the question “What is the additional effect of the treatment?” \\(ATT = E[\\delta_i \\mid \\textrm{in treatment group}]\\) represents the Average Treatment effect of the Treatment group, \\(E[Y^1_i - Y^0_i \\mid \\textrm{in treatment group}]\\). In other words, \\(ATT\\) answers the question “What is the additional effect of the treatment for those in the treatment group?” \\(ATU = E[\\delta_i \\mid \\textrm{in control group}]\\) represents the Average Treatment effect of the Untreated (control) group, \\(E[Y^1_i - Y^0_i \\mid \\textrm{in control group}]\\). In other words, \\(ATU\\) answers the question “What is the additional effect of the treatment for those in the control group?” \\(ATE\\) can be decomposed into a weighted average of \\(ATT, ATU\\), such that \\(ATE = p\\times ATT + (1-p)\\times ATU\\), where \\(p\\) is the weight of the treatment group. In our scenario, \\(ATE\\) represents the expected marginal effect of the tutorial group on test scores for all students, \\(ATT\\) represents the expected marginal effect of the tutorial group for students who participate in tutorials, and \\(ATU\\) represents the expected marginal effect of the tutorial group for students who do not participate in tutorials. Estimates may be biased because we do not randomly assign students to tutorials - we select them for each group based on some criteria. Using randomization inference, we can separate assignment bias from the estimates of \\(ATT, ATU\\) to find appropriate estimates and p-values on \\(ATE\\). 8.1.1.2 Matching models We can leverage large samples to find a potential outcome for a student by matching other students who are reasonably similar, using a specified distance measure. Thus, we can reasonably estimate \\(ATE\\) since we have both the treatment and control outcomes. By using the matchit package in R, we can specify covariates we would like to match in our data between the treatment and control groups. #use matchit like a glm m_out &lt;- matchit(ActiveIL ~ Race + Gender + Grade + SPED + LEP + EcoDis + GradeEquivalentBOY, #response specifies control/treatment, covariates specify what to match data = rs_il_mod, method = &quot;cem&quot;, #specify matching method link = &quot;logit&quot;, estimand = &quot;ATT&quot;) #produces data frame with needed weights m_data &lt;- match.data(m_out) #model uses weighted linear model to estimate causal effect of using Imagine Learning m_att &lt;- lm_robust(GradeEquivalentGrowth ~ ActiveIL, data = m_data, weights = m_data$weights) summary(m_att) 8.1.1.3 Regression discontinuity 8.1.1.4 Instrumental variables 8.1.1.5 Difference-in-differences 8.1.2 Experimental design suggested topics - ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA, nested, mixed effects, crossover design, etc. 8.2 Descriptive statistics When summarizing a distribution of data, we are usually tasked with describing (1) measures of center, such as counts and proportions for categorical data, or means and medians for quantitative data and then displaying those values for our stakeholders. To provide context and increase the statistical literacy of our team and family, we also describe the (2) spread, (3) shape, and (4) unusual features of the distribution. 8.2.1 Numerical summaries - broad principles For categorical data, consider the distribution of proportions and counts (the sample size) across the various categories. One-way and two-way frequency tables, with marginal and total proportions and counts, are useful for displaying the data. For univariate, quantitative data, use the shape of the distribution to determine appropriate numerical measures. For symmetric data, the mean \\(\\bar{x}\\) mean(x) and standard deviation \\(s\\) sd(x) can be appropriate for reporting and is accessible by a broad audience. For skewed data, consider the median \\(\\tilde{x}\\) median(x) (and possibly the MAD - median absolute deviation mad(x)), and provide context for choosing these measures. Note: The median is also a widely accessible statistic to most people, since it describes the midpoint of your distribution. Consider using it alongside the mean. For bivariate data, use a scatterplot to determine if linear measures can be used appropriately. The Pearson correlation \\(r\\) cor(x, y) can be easily understood by a wide audience to describe the linear strength of a bivariate association. However, the Spearman rank correlation cor(x, y, method = \"spearman\") can provide an associative measure for monotonic nonlinear associations, and Kendall’s \\(\\tau\\) cor(x, y, method = \"kendall\") can describe concordance for ordinal data. When describing outliers in a report, care should be taken when describing how we identify and use (or remove) the outliers from the data set. One heuristic for deciding what to do with an outlier is to ask yourself, “Does this observation belong in the sample?” If you decide that the observation is fundamentally different than the others (e.g. a school is off-model and does not implement the Imagine Learning the same way that other schools do), then you might consider removing that observation. If the observation represents some exceptional case of the proposed model, then you might consider keeping that observation. In general, we should be modeling a measure of center and its spread as a function of covariates (see Modeling and predictive statistics). 8.2.2 Graphical summaries - broad principles While there are plenty of ways to display data, all graphs should be accompanied by an explanation of key features. Our aim is to help educators interpret the data in memorable, meaningful ways, and graphs without context can convey the wrong information or may obscure what the researcher attempted to communicate. Each graph should include a descriptive title, axes, and appropriate labels; consider using the ideacolors package for aesthetics. Selecting an appropriate graphical display depends on the purpose of the analysis and the communication of results. Bar graphs, line graphs, histograms, and scatterplots each have their place in displaying central tendency; however, emphasis should be placed on displaying variation within the data. 8.2.2.1 Displaying variation Variation can be addressed by the following (non-exhaustive) list: Comparing sample sizes, both for the entire distribution and within each group Comparing variation within and between groups Displaying variation across time Clustering of values in a region (and conversely, gaps in data) Different approaches to this could be altering alpha values, jittering, color scales, size, and the shape of the marker. Some sample code for doing is found below: make_Data_By_Launch_Cohort() %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = LaunchSchoolYear, y = jitter(MedianGrowth), #jittering of clustered points group = School)) + geom_point(aes(color = School, #change color by school alpha = 0.2), #set transparency level to 0.2 size = 3.5) + #increases size of point geom_point(aes(y = MedianGrowthLaunch, color = LaunchOrder), shape = 3, #changes shape to plus sign + size = 5) + scale_color_idea() + theme_idea_light() + facet_wrap(~LaunchOrder, labeller = labeller(LaunchOrder = c(&quot;1&quot; = &quot;First Year&quot;, &quot;2&quot; = &quot;Second Year&quot;, &quot;3&quot; = &quot;Third Year&quot;))) + labs(title = &quot;Median RenStar Reading Growth&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Results grouped by schools launching in the same year&quot;, caption = &quot;+ represents median RenStar reading growth for that launching cohort&quot;, x = &quot;Launch Year&quot;, y = &quot;Median RenStar Growth&quot;) + scale_x_discrete(labels = c(&quot;2017-2018&quot; = &quot;2017-18&quot;, &quot;2018-2019&quot; = &quot;2018-19&quot;, &quot;2019-2020&quot; = &quot;2019-20&quot;, &quot;2020-2021&quot; = &quot;2020-21&quot;)) + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) This code spaces out MedianGrowth if there are multiple schools with the same median growth, changes the transparency level to 0.2, and changes color wtih each school. The value of MedianGrowthLaunch is plotted with a “plus” shape at a larger size to emphasize the median growth for each school year. This image shows a graph of median RenStar growth levels from launching schools in different school years and shows variation in those medians. 8.3 Inferential statistics suggested topics - confidence intervals vs. p-values and communication 8.4 Modeling and predictive statistics 8.4.1 Linear modeling suggested topics - uses, diagnostics, commands, interpreting, limitations, conclusions, communication 8.4.2 Generalized linear modeling suggested topics - uses, diagnostics, commands, interpreting, limitations, conclusions, communication multinomial logit, log models, zero-inflated models 8.4.3 Machine learning "],["tips-and-tricks.html", "Chapter 9 Tips and Tricks 9.1 Data processing", " Chapter 9 Tips and Tricks This section of the R&amp;A Manual is for sharing various tricks that are will make you life easier. Rules of thumb, explanations of how things work, and useful design patterns are all fair game. 9.1 Data processing 9.1.1 De-duplicating rows in a table. There are two general purpose design patterns for de-duplicating rows in a table in either R or SQL. In R use the dplyr::distinct() function and in SQL use a DISTINCT clause. This is pretty simple and robust, with the typical use case of wanting to reduce many identical rows to a single row. If you are trying to de-duplicate where you may have non-identical rows (e.g., a student has taken the same assessment multiple times in a testing window and you’d like to get the latest date) then you can use a group_by-arrange-row_number-filter pattern: Group you data by the columns that uniquely identify your object of inquiry (e.g., student number) Arrange or sort the data by a column that puts an ordering you care about within the grouped data (e.g., assessment date) Create a new column that contains the row number within the group (e.g, a student with 5 assessments in a window would have row_number = 1 for the first date and row_number = 5 for the last date). Filter for the maximum row number(with dplyr::filter() in R or a WHERE clause in SQL) (optional) Ungroup your data. 9.1.2 Creating “Scaffolds” when joining data. Coming Soon. . .
