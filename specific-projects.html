</h2>
<p>Teacher Hiring is a project for the HA team to help inform selection processes for hiring teachers. This is an on-going project that started in Spring 20-21 with Anitra and has transferred over to Martin Winchester and Emily Neilson. There have been multiple rounds of correlations and modeling examining the relationship between 5 pre-determined pre-hire selection measures and teacher performance, as indicated and measured by TCP (level and composite score). The first round looked at regressions models with each separate pre-hire selection measure predicting TCP level/composite score, and then a model using all 5 pre-hire selection measures to predict TCP level/composite score. Next, a selection score was created by allotting points to the different selection measures, in accordance with the HA Team’s guidelines on how various selection measures are scored. The models were rerun. In all cases, very little to no correlation or predictive power was found in these relationships.</p>
<p>The scope of this project in initial rounds was limited to only those who were hired, or in the Jobvite data column “Hire Y/N”, Hire=Yes. Predictions of TCP scores could not be made for those applicants who were not hired.</p>
<p>Later and current rounds have focused on ML techniques to do the modeling instead of limiting it to only linear regression and correlation matrices. Missingness of the data was a key issue in this decision. Over 50% of the data was not present in Jobvite, as candidates were not required to fill in all the sections nor all the pre-hire selection measures. These were left as optional. One recommendation of the R&amp;A team was to require all sections to be completed by applicants on the Jobvite application and prior to hire, and then to collect and record this data. Another recommendation was to collect and record Writing Task Scores. 99% of those scores were not recorded, but this Writing Task was 12 points of the First Hurdle selection score in the selection process. For the Machine Learning applications, we have included all the missing data and coded it with it’s own value, and then it was run through the ML algorithms. We were looking to see if “not filling in” certain information or all one’s pre-hire selection measure data on teh application had a relationship to poorer outcomes on TCP.</p>
<p>Data was provided originally by Brittany Vasquez from the HA team, and from Alfredo from Tyler Munis.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">6.1.1</span> Jobvite Data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#jobvite-data-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Obtained from HA team. It is the data from the candidates who apply for IDEA jobs through Jobvite. Not all candidates applied through Jobvite in the past, but HA is trying to streamline the application process and require all applicants for all jobs (at all campuses) to apply through a central system, which is Jobvite.</p>
<p>A particular Jobvite file is labeled with a year, such as “Jobvite 19-20”, and it will have column “Candidate Submit Date”, which is a range from October 2019 to July 2019 (October to July, proceeding the year the applicant will likely begin work). An applicant from that range will most likely have a Start Date of August 2019 (or sometime in the calendar year 2019, starting AFTER the 19-20 Academic Year). However, there are cases when applicants will, for example, apply during the 10/2018 - 07/2019 cycle (Jobvite 19-20), but will not have a Start Date until 2020 or 2021 (so they do not start the following FAll after the application cycle).</p>
<p>This data has columns including Candidate Full Name, Candidate Email (personal email used for the application), and some of the pre-hire selection measures, such as GPA. However, all 5 of the pre-hire selection measures are not included yet (Stem Major, Teach For America status, Experience prior to IDEA, GPA, and Teacher Certification). The data also has no Employee IDs yet, as this is a list of candidates. There is a Hire Yes/No column, which has “Yes” for those candidates who were offered a position and “No” for those who were not offered a position. Also, there is a Requisition ID which is basically an application ID number, and it is unique per application. If a single candidate applies for more than one position, the candidate will have a unique ID for each application.</p>

</h3>
<p>A job analysis is being conducted to try to find job-relatedness for functions conducted in the teacher role, as well as to help identify pre-hire selection measures for the HA team to help with the selection process. This involves a series of neutrally-phrased questions to illicit reponses about the teacher role, what a teacher does, what makes a successful IDEA teacher, what characteristics a teacher needs to succeed at IDEA. Both teachers and teacher-managers (principals, PIRs, and APIs) are being interviewed to collect this qualitative data set. These should be completed by Fall 2022 SY.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> First Year Teacher Project<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#first-year-teacher-project"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>This was a project for HA. Malinda Hardy and Martin Winchester headed it as our partners in HA. IT was started in Fall 21, for the 21-22 SY. The research question examined was “How do first-year teachers do compared to teachers with other tenure on student achievement?”. To examine this question, we obtained the Semester Exam data for 20-21 SY and ran our models. The 21-22 SY data was not out at the time, so we set up the coding and models so that later we could just plug in the 21-22 SY data when it was available. We plugged in this data in Spring 22, when it was available in late January/early February. Visuals including box plots were created to show the median pass rate per teacher. First, boxes were broken into two categories: 1st year teacher and non-first-year teacher. There was little difference in the median pass rates (pass rates meant the student had achieved Approaches, Meets, or Masters on the semester exam, taken at the end of the 21-22 SY Fall Semester). Next, 6 gropus were created and compared: 1st year, 2nd year, 3rd year, 4th year, and 5th+ year (anyone was 5 years or more in tenure at IDEA). There was also little difference in the median pass rates, for both 20-21 SY and 21-22 SY. One reason could be because everyone, regardless of tenure at IDEA was a “first year teacher online” for remote teaching, during the pandemic.</p>

</h3>
<p>In subsequent rounds, the 19-20 SY data was looked at for semester exams and compared to 20-21 SY and 21-22 SY. Since students took their 19-20 SY semester exams in the Fall semester of that academic year, they took them before the pandemic and the lock-down (which happened in Spring 2020). Hence, this is “pre-pandemic” data. This data did show slight differences in the median pass rates between first year and other years of teaching, namely, 3rd, 4th, and 5th years of teaching.</p>
<p>The analysis further looked at individual subjects (ELA, Math, Science, History-Social Studies, Foreign Language, and Technology). Those six subjects were chosen because they all take semester exams. There were individual differences depending on which subject was examined. The analysis also looked at College Prep vs. Academy, and looked at the results by Region (showing the results for each campus within the respective region).</p>
<p>Results were presented to Malinda Hardy via PowerPoint by Maura and for some rounds, Steven. There were 4 rounds and each round was added to the same PowerPoint presentation.</p>

<p>This project has been transfered over to Ann Heller because Malinda is leaving and Ann is taking over the New Teacher Institute. This transfer happened in late May/Early June 2022, and Ann has no research questions for us at this time after giving her a short PowerPoint presentation overview of the prior 4 rounds. She may come back in the Fall/October 2022 with more questions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Math Curriculum Redesign<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#math-curriculum-redesign"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>This project was examining the differences between student achievement for pilot vs. non-pilot schools, for a new math curriculum that is being implemented. The pilot was not set up at-random, and project design was not created by R&amp;A. It was challenging to find meaningful results because it was hard to tease apart the impacts of particular things on student achievement. It was difficult to know if a change in test scores was due to the new curriculum or something else. The results showed that although the test scores may not have been significantly different/better for pilot than the non-pilot schools, the pilot schools lowest scores were not as low as the non-pilot schools. In effect, the pilot schools did not do worse in terms of the lowest scores, so we could likely say the the new math curriculum was not harming the students (although it was hard to say if it was helping). We may revisit this project for AP classes and help our partners design the pilots and project design for the next round, which will hopefully support getting more meaningful results from the analysis.</p>
