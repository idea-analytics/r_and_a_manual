<p>How do we organize and guide our work on evaluation projects? Evaluation plans are prepared annually for each annually funded grant project and published to our Team Site. Annual evaluation projects may include several specific projects that directly inform the ongoing evaluation work. Evaluation plans are also developed for ad hoc and specific evaluation needs, topics, and projects.</p>

</h3>
<p>About Annual Evaluation Plans</p>
<p>The annual evaluation plan provides a summary of the plan of work for a specific program, grant, or service during a fiscal year. Evaluation plans adhere to <a href="https://www.eval.org/About/Guiding-Principles#:~:text=The%20Guiding%20Principles%20reflect%20the,Principles%20are%20interdependent%20and%20interconnected.">American Evaluation Association (AEA) guidelines and standards</a> for high quality evaluation. Individual plans may be customized to best reflect the work appropriate to the project.</p>
<p>Evaluation plans serve to communicate the plan of work and guide expectations among stakeholders interested in the evaluation work. Evaluation plans may include the following components: a program description; evaluation purpose, objectives, and evaluation or research questions; methods and scope of the evaluation, data collection, and data analysis; timeline; required reporting and deliverables; and program support. Components are described in more detail in <a href="evaluation-projects.html#evaluation-plan-guidelines">Evaluation Plan Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Evaluation plans are created with program and grant managers. Evaluation plans are drafted by evaluation staff and shared with program managers and partners for review, feedback, and approval. Annual evaluation plans must be finalized and approved by September 30. Although the annual evaluation plan is agreed upon at the beginning of the year, unexpected events, challenges, or circumstances may necessitate changes to the plan. The evaluation plan is subject to change through agreed upon decision making between the program manager and evaluation staff. Evaluators are held accountable to producing evaluation plans and meeting the milestone requirements included in the timeline and overall evaluation plan.</p>

</h3>
<p>IDEA Public Schools’ 21st Century Afterschool program provides high quality programming for students in the hours before and after the traditional school day has ended. The afterschool program allows IDEA schools to make a positive difference in the lives of students with greatest needs, as the program aims to provide additional support and ensure that all students are receiving the guidance and assistance they need to successfully progress towards college completion. The 21st Century program is centered around four main goals for students: increasing achievement scores, improving student behavior and attendance, and increasing rates of graduation or grade promotion towards timely graduation.</p>
<p>During the 2021-2022 school year, the majority of IDEA schools implementing the Afterschool Program were funded by the 10th cycle of the 21st Century grant or by the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSER). These schools were located in the South Texas and Rio Grande Valley and served students from pre-K through 12th grade. The following campuses were funded by the 21st Century grant: IDEA Alamo, IDEA Donna, IDEA Frontier, IDEA McAllen, IDEA Mission, IDEA Pharr, IDEA Quest, IDEA San Benito, IDEA San Juan, and IDEA Weslaco. The following campuses were covered by ESSER funds: IDEA Brownsville, IDEA Edinburg, IDEA Elsa, IDEA Harlingen, IDEA La Joya, IDEA Los Encinos, IDEA North Mission, IDEA Owassa, IDEA Palmview, IDEA Rio Grande City, IDEA Robindale, IDEA Riverview, IDEA Sports Park, IDEA Toros, IDEA Tres Lagos, IDEA Weslaco Pike. In addition, IDEA Health Professions was funded by the Department of Education and IDEA Innovation was funded by the Louisiana Department of Education.</p>
<p>The Afterschool Program evaluation plan for school year 2022-2023 can be found <a href="https://ideapublicschoolsorg.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/ResearchandAnalysis/EezZf9Bi5y5MpSGLsz5mzGoBRKe6kiUfvGiHdBpGG7KQzg?e=xMZGZg">here</a>.

<p>Student participation in the Afterschool program is tracked in PowerSchool and then pulled into the R&amp;A data warehouse server. The program coordinators track the programs that the students participate in and if they have participated for more that 45 days. Students that participate 45 days or more are classified as “Regular Participants”. Student that participate for fewer than 45 days are classified as “Non-Regular Participants”.</p>

The programs are offered at 26 campuses in the RGV, Health Professions in Austin, and Innovation in Louisiana.</p>

</h3>
<p>Camp RIO has been in operation since 2015 as a year-round outdoor education and summer camp facility. It is located on 85-acres of predominantly untouched wildlife preserve in Brownsville, Texas and is accessible to all regardless of school district, ability, or age. Camp RIO is a facility designed for outdoor discovery and adventure with a mission of promoting healthy lifestyles by exposing children to the benefits of exploration, land stewardship, and staying active through various hands-on activities.</p>
<p>The program provides guided outdoor activities such as fishing, canoeing, building campfires, geocaching, hiking, and archery which help connect participants to their community and nature. From its inception in 2015, the number of students attending Camp Rio per year has increased from a few hundred to over 28,000 students in the 2021-2022 school year.</p>
<p>The program evaluation for Camp Rio focuses on 3 main goals:
1) To understand the short- and long-term association between students’ participation in Camp RIO and students’ interests in natural resources and land stewardship
2) To evaluate the short- and long-term association between participation in Camp RIO and student academic achievement and well-being<br>
3) To understand the long-term association between participation in Camp RIO and student college and career choices in the natural sciences<br>

<p>R&amp;A conducts internal evaluation work for two CSP grants:
1) CSP Grants 2019-2024 and 2) CSP Grants 2020-2025.</p>
<p>CSP Grant 2017-2022 evaluation work was conducted by a contracted agency.</p>
<p>Charter School Program (CSP) grants awarded to IDEA Public Schools provide funds for replication and expansion of new IDEA schools. Replication refers to launching new schools. Expansion refers to scaling new schools.</p>
<p>CSP grant applications were submitted and approved for funding. The grant application provides general guidance for evaluation. CSP evaluation work is informed by evaluation questions and aims to address the following areas: implementation of the IDEA model, needs and challenges, supports, and sustainability strategies. Primary metrics for reporting outcomes include student enrollment, student persistence, student academic performance, and employee retention.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>CSP Schools and Regions</strong>
CSP evaluation focuses on schools launching or scaling during SY 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, 2022-2023, 2023-2024, and 2024-2025 in 12 regions.</p></li>

<p>Most schools open or launch with Kindergarten, 1st, and 2nd grades at the Academy level and 6th grade at the College Prep level. However there are exceptions to this model.</p>
