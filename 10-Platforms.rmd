# Platforms

This section of the R&A Manual concerns details on the various software platforms we use: general purpose of the software, some steps for using the software, and useful links for learning more about it.

## Qualtrics

Qualtrics is a survey and data collection platform. It allows for survey building, distribution of links via email or text, response analysis, and reporting. A particularly useful feature of Qualtrics is the ability to upload a list of email addresses with information associated with each email address and then send a personalized survey link to each email address selected from the list. For example, in surveying district teachers one may want their responses disaggregated by race/ethnicity, school of employment, and grade level. This information can be linked to each teacherâ€™s email address and uploaded into Qualtrics prior to surveying the teachers. As data is collected, each response will have the uploaded pieces of information associated to it.

The following sessions outline how to create a survey, upload a list of email addresses to survey, and create a basic live report for your survey. 

### Creating a New Survey

You can start a new survey from a blank survey form or by copying and modifying an existing survey. Either way, when you log into Qualtrics, you will have an option for what you want to do next. Assuming you have a user license, to log into Qualtrics go to IDEAps.Qualtrics.com and select the single sign-on (SSO) option. Any projects that you have created or that have been shared with you will be listed on the left side of the window and right below this list you will find a button for creating a new survey.

On the next page, you will have the option to create a project as a survey. Select that option and press get started.
On the next page, you will name your survey and will be allowed to start a survey from a blank project, copy a survey from an existing project, or use a survey previously stored in your library. If you are starting from a blank project, the next sections in this manual discuss types of items and next steps in building your survey.

### Advanced Reports

In Qualtrics, you can create an advanced report found under the 'Reports' tab. The Reports tool allows you to create static or live reports from a blank form or by copying and modifying an existing report.  

You are able to customize reports based on your survey. Visualizations include charts (i.e.,  bar, line, pie, breakdown), tables (i.e., data, statistics, results), and heat maps. 

Using the breakdown visualization, you can breakdown items by certain demographics and apply a Display Logic (which displays the data presented in the visual if certain criteria are met). However, it is important to keep in mind that Display Logic applies to the total count (N) and is not specific to Breakout Groups count (n).
