# Specific Projects

The R&A Team works on all sorts of projects and topics. This section provides more information about our specific projects.

Some of our data analysis work is done on an annual basis, such as analyzing academic performance on state standardized tests or student persistence. In other project areas, we analyze data and share updates on a weekly or monthly basis (i.e., senior college applications, ACT test scores). We also conduct in-depth analyses that may involve multiple quantitative, machine learning, and qualitative methods to gain breadth and depth for understanding a particular topic. Grant-funded evaluation work is another example of our specific projects.

## We could move content

Make the current RMD as chapter 6 Specific Projects. 
Move content in 5.6 (5.6.1 through 5.6.5) to Chapter 6 Specific Projects.
Have Chapter 5 Projects focus on project applications and Chapter 6 focus on project specifics.

## File Storage

Our work on specific projects may be stored in different places depending on the project and team member(s). 

### R&A Private Group

The R&A Private Group documents folder provides a convenient and accessible storage place for all R&A team members to access shared folders and documents. Highly useful for projects that require multiple team members, storing and accessing files the private group folder helps to ensure  consistency and continuity of work. 

The R&A Private Group documents folder is not to be confused with the [Team Site (TheHub)][Team Site (TheHub)] or the [Team Site (TheHub)][Team Site (TheHub)] documents folder. 


## Evaluations

The R&A team evaluates four (4) annually funded grants including: 1) 21st Century Afterschool Program, 2) Camp Rio, 3) Charter School Program, and Teacher and School Leader Incentive Program. 

### Evaluation Plans 

Evaluation Plans are prepared annually to...be continued. The purpose of evaluation plans are to..be continued from policy and guidelines content files.

Evaluation Plans for the current fiscal year are published to the [Team Site (TheHub)][Team Site (TheHub)]. 

Evaluation planning resources and files are stored in the [R&A Private Group][R&A Private Group] Evaluation folder. 

### 21st Century Afterschool Program

TBD things to know about this specific project.

### Camp Rio

TBD things to know about this specific project.

### Charter School Program (CSP) Grants

R&A conducts evaluation work for two CSP grants:
1) CSP Grants 2019-2024 and 2) CSP Grants 2020-2025. 

CSP Grant 2017-2022 evaluation work was conducted by a contracted agency.

### Teacher Hiring and TCP

Copy/paste content here from 5.6.1
Teacher Hiring is a project for the HA team to help inform selection processes for hiring teachers. This is an on-going project that started in Spring 20-21 with Anitra and has transferred over to Martin Winchester and Emily Neilson. There have been multiple rounds of correlations and modeling examining the relationship between 5 pre-determined pre-hire selection measures and teacher performance, as indicated and measured by TCP (level and composite score). The first round looked at regressions models with each separate pre-hire selection measure predicting TCP level/composite score, and then a model using all 5 pre-hire selection measures to predict TCP level/composite score. Next, a selection score was created by allotting points to the different selection measures, in accordance with the HA Team's guidelines on how various selection measures are scored. The models were rerun. In all cases, very little to no correlation or predictive power was found in these relationships. 


The scope of this project in initial rounds was limited to only those who were hired, or in the Jobvite data column "Hire Y/N", Hire=Yes. Predictions of TCP scores could not be made for those applicants who were not hired.

Later and current rounds have focused on ML techniques to do the modeling instead of limiting it to only linear regression and correlation matrices. Missingness of the data was a key issue in this decision. Over 50% of the data was not present in Jobvite, as candidates were not required to fill in all the sections nor all the pre-hire selection measures. These were left as optional. One recommendation of the R&A team was to require all sections to be completed by applicants on the Jobvite application and prior to hire, and then to collect and record this data. Another recommendation was to collect and record Writing Task Scores. 99% of those scores were not recorded, but this Writing Task was 12 points of the First Hurdle selection score in the selection process. For the Machine Learning applications, we have included all the missing data and coded it with it's own value, and then it was run through the ML algorithms. We were looking to see if "not filling in" certain information or all one's pre-hire selection measure data on the application had a relationship to poorer outcomes on TCP.

Data was provided originally by Brittany Vasquez from the HA team, and from Alfredo from Tyler Munis.

#### Jobvite Data

Obtained from HA team. It is the data from the candidates who apply for IDEA jobs through Jobvite. Not all candidates applied through Jobvite in the past, but HA is trying to streamline the application process and require all applicants for all jobs (at all campuses) to apply through a central system, which is Jobvite. 

A particular Jobvite file is labeled with a year, such as "Jobvite 19-20", and it will have column "Candidate Submit Date", which is a range from October 2019 to July 2019 (October to July, proceeding the year the applicant will likely begin work). An applicant from that range will most likely have a Start Date of August 2019 (or sometime in the calendar year 2019, starting AFTER the 19-20 Academic Year). However, there are cases when applicants will, for example, apply during the 10/2018 - 07/2019 cycle (Jobvite 19-20), but will not have a Start Date until 2020 or 2021 (so they do not start the following FAll after the application cycle). 
          
This data has columns including Candidate Full Name, Candidate Email (personal email used for the application), and some of the pre-hire selection measures, such as GPA. However, all 5 of the pre-hire selection measures are not included yet (Stem Major, Teach For America status, Experience prior to IDEA, GPA, and Teacher Certification). The data also has no Employee IDs yet, as this is a list of candidates. There is a Hire Yes/No column, which has "Yes" for those candidates who were offered a position and "No" for those who were not offered a position. Also, there is a Requisition ID which is basically an application ID number, and it is unique per application. If a single candidate applies for more than one position, the candidate will have a unique ID for each application.

#### Teacher Export Data

This is found on the TCP application, a website: [tcp.ideapublicschools.org]. To gain access, contact Nohemi Pizana and request access. Use your IDEA login credentials to access the site. Teacher Export reports have the composite score, placement level, subject, job title, employee ID, and a few pre-selection hiring measures.


#### TCP Handbook

This is the link to the TCP Handbook, which denotes the business rules to advance throught the different TCP Levels, 1 through 5. https://ideapublicschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/TCP-Revised-Rubrics-2020-2021.Sept_.25.2020.pdf


#### Teacher Interviews/Teacher Manager Interviews

Copy/paste content here from 5.6.1.4
A job analysis is being conducted to try to find job-relatedness for functions conducted in the teacher role, as well as to help identify pre-hire selection measures for the HA team to help with the selection process. This involves a series of neutrally-phrased questions to illicit reponses about the teacher role, what a teacher does, what makes a successful IDEA teacher, what characteristics a teacher needs to succeed at IDEA. Both teachers and teacher-managers (principals, PIRs, and APIs) are being interviewed to collect this qualitative data set. These should be completed by Fall 2022 SY.
