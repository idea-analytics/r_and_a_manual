</h2>
<p>IDEA’s Research and Analysis Team (R&amp;A) provides leaders at all levels in IDEA the insights, findings, and tools required to make the best short- and long-term decisions on behalf of students and families. R&amp;A finds opportunities for improvement and investments, locates exemplars and best-practices, and embeds analyses and insights in tools and reports.</p>
<p>Succinctly, the R&amp;A team separates and communicates signal from noise which has the following impacts on the organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Actionable decision support</strong>: Leaders are as informed as quickly possible when making decisions and can draw clear, correct inferences; they know that all our data has been utilized to the best extent possible and they will be well informed to make decisions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strategic support</strong>: Long-term investments with high ROI are pursued; strategies that are ineffective are adjusted so they are or are replaced by activities that move us closer to our goal of college for all.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tactical guidance</strong>: Nimbly surmise what is working in pilots or across region(s) and communicate these findings clearly; Ensure that decisions are not pushed from one school year to the next.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Short Cycle Improvements</strong>: Analyze and understand short-to-medium term impacts of program choices and with business partners provide actionable recommendations in a cycle of continuous improvement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Educate our partners</strong>: Assist our team in family in understanding what is and what is not possible with data, that is what analyses can be performed, what nuggets of wisdom can be mined, and where we face limitation and need to bring substantive expertise from outside R&amp;A.</p></li>
