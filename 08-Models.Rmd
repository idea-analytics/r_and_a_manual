# Models and Methods 

Our research involves a wide variety of methods in statistics and data science to analyze problems and answer questions in educational data. In consultation with our stakeholders, we carefully select the most relevant approach(es) to provide an appropriate and accurate product.

We use methods in descriptive, inferential, and predictive statistics to understand information about our organization. However, the design of the program influences how we establish our methods of research.

## Research design

### Causal inference

suggested topics - potential outcomes, matching models, etc.

### Experimental design

suggested topics - ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA, nested, mixed effects, crossover design, etc.

## Descriptive statistics

When summarizing a distribution of data, we are usually tasked with describing (1) measures of center, such as counts and proportions for categorical data, or means and medians for quantitative data and then displaying those values for our stakeholders. To provide context and increase the statistical literacy of our team and family, we also describe the (2) spread, (3) shape, and (4) unusual features of the distribution.

### Numerical summaries - broad principles

For **categorical data**, consider the distribution of proportions and counts (the sample size) across the various categories. One-way and two-way frequency tables, with marginal and total proportions and counts, are useful for displaying the data.

For **univariate, quantitative data**, use the shape of the distribution to determine appropriate numerical measures. For symmetric data, the mean $\bar{x}$ `mean(x)` and standard deviation $s$ `sd(x)` can be appropriate for reporting and is accessible by a broad audience. For skewed data, consider the median $\tilde{x}$ `median(x)` (and possibly the MAD - median absolute deviation `mad(x)`), and provide context for choosing these measures. Note: The median is also a widely accessible statistic to most people, since it describes the midpoint of your distribution. Consider using it alongside the mean.

For **bivariate data**, use a scatterplot to determine if linear measures can be used appropriately. The Pearson correlation $r$ `cor(x, y)` can be easily understood by a wide audience to describe the linear strength of a bivariate association. However, the Spearman rank correlation `cor(x, y, method = "spearman")` can provide an associative measure for monotonic nonlinear associations, and Kendall's $\tau$ `cor(x, y, method = "kendall")` can describe concordance for ordinal data.

When describing **outliers** in a report, care should be taken when describing how we identify and use (or remove) the outliers from the data set. 

::: {.tip}
One heuristic for deciding what to do with an outlier is to ask yourself, "Does this observation *belong* in the sample?"

If you decide that the observation is fundamentally different than the others (e.g. a school is off-model and does not implement the Imagine Learning the same way that other schools do), then you might consider removing that observation. If the observation represents some exceptional case of the proposed model, then you might consider keeping that observation.

In general, we should be modeling a measure of center and its spread as a function of covariates (see Modeling and predictive statistics).

### Graphical summaries - broad principles

While there are plenty of ways to display data, all graphs should be accompanied by an explanation of key features. Our aim is to help educators interpret the data in memorable, meaningful ways, and graphs without context can convey the wrong information or may obscure what the researcher attempted to communicate. Each graph should include a descriptive title, axes, and appropriate labels; consider using the [ideacolors](https://idea-analytics.github.io/ideacolors/) package for aesthetics.

Selecting an appropriate graphical display depends on the purpose of the analysis and the communication of results. Bar graphs, line graphs, histograms, and scatterplots each have their place in displaying central tendency; however, emphasis should be placed on displaying variation within the data.

#### Displaying variation

Variation can be addressed by the following (non-exhaustive) list:

1. Comparing sample sizes, both for the entire distribution and within each group

2. Comparing variation within and between groups

3. Displaying variation across time

4. Clustering of values in a region (and conversely, gaps in data)
