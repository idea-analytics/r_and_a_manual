# Models and Methods 

Our research involves a wide variety of methods in statistics and data science to analyze problems and answer questions in educational data. In consultation with our stakeholders, we carefully select the most relevant approach(es) to provide an appropriate and accurate product.

We use methods in descriptive, inferential, and predictive statistics to understand information about our organization. However, the design of the program influences how we establish our methods of research.

## Research design

### Causal inference

suggested topics - potential outcomes, matching models, etc.

### Experimental design

suggested topics - ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA, nested, mixed effects, crossover design, etc.

## Descriptive statistics

### Numerical summaries - broad principles

suggested topics - using measures of center AND spread, identifying outliers, describing a mean, describing a mean as a function of other covariates (lead into modeling section)

### Graphical summaries - broad principles

## Inferential statistics

## Modeling and predictive statistics

### Linear modeling

suggested topics - uses, diagnostics, commands, interpreting, limitations, conclusions, communication

### Generalized linear modeling

suggested topics - uses, diagnostics, commands, interpreting, limitations, conclusions, communication

multinomial logit, log models, zero-inflated models

### Machine learning
