# Models and Methods 

Our research involves a wide variety of methods in statistics and data science to analyze problems and answer questions in educational data. In consultation with our stakeholders, we carefully select the most relevant approach(es) to provide an appropriate and accurate summary, inference, visualization or prediction.

## Statistical approaches

We use methods in descriptive, inferential, and predictive statistics to understand information about our organization. However, the design of the program influences how we establish our methods of research.

### Research design

#### Causal inference

### Descriptive statistics

#### Numerical summaries - broad principles

#### Graphical summaries - broad principles

### Inferential statistics

#### Classical inference

### Predictive statistics - modeling

#### Linear modeling

#### Generalized linear modeling
