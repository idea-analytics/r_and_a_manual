# Models and Methods 

Our research involves a wide variety of methods in statistics and data science to analyze problems and answer questions in educational data. In consultation with our stakeholders, we carefully select the most relevant approach(es) to provide an appropriate and accurate product.

We use methods in descriptive, inferential, and predictive statistics to understand information about our organization. However, the design of the program influences how we establish our methods of research.

## Research design

### Causal inference

suggested topics - potential outcomes, matching models, etc.

### Experimental design

suggested topics - ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA, nested, mixed effects, crossover design, etc.

## Descriptive statistics

When summarizing a distribution of data, we are usually tasked with finding counts and proportions for categorical data, or means and medians for quantitative data and then displaying those values for our stakeholders. To provide context and increase the statistical literacy of our team and family, we also describe the spread, shape, and unusual features of the distribution.

### Numerical summaries - broad principles

suggested topics - using measures of center AND spread, identifying outliers, describing a mean, describing a mean as a function of other covariates (lead into modeling section)

For categorical data, consider the distribution of proportions and counts (the sample size) across the various categories. One-way and two-way frequency tables, with marginal and total proportions and counts, are useful for displaying the data.

For univariate quantitative data, use the shape of the distribution to determine appropriate numerical measures. For symmetric data, the mean $\bar{x}$ `mean(x)` and standard deviation $s$ `sd(x)` can be appropriate for reporting and can be more easily understood by a broader audience. For skewed data, consider the median $\tilde{x}$ `median(x)` (and possibly the MAD - median absolute deviation `mad(x)`), and provide context for choosing these measures.

For bivariate data, use a scatterplot to determine if linear measures can be used appropriately. The Pearson correlation $r$ `cor(x, y)` can be easily understood by a wide audience to describe the linear strength of a bivariate association. However, the Spearman rank correlation `cor(x, y, method = "spearman")` can provide an associative measure for monotonic nonlinear associations, and Kendall's $\tau$ `cor(x, y, method = "kendall")` can describe concordance for ordinal data.

When describing outliers in a report, care should be taken when describing how we identify and use (or remove) the outliers from the data set.

In general, we should be modeling a measure of center and its spread as a function of covariates (see Modeling and predictive statistics).
