# Geospatial Methods and GIS

This chapter provides a gentle introduction to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in R with simple features. 

## What is a simple feature?

**Simple Features** is a set of ISO and Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards that specify a common storage and access model of geographic feature made of mostly two-dimensional geometries (point, line, polygon, multi-point, multi-line, etc.) used by geographic information systems. Simple features underlie the most common commercial and open-source GIS platforms (e.g., ESRI ArcGIS, PostGIS, the GeoJSON standard).

A **feature** is essentially a thing in the world. In the simple feature specification a feature has *a geometry* describing where on Earth the feature is located, **and they have attributes**, which describe other properties, like names or metrics such as population.

### How are simple features implemented in R

In a word, simply. A special feature in R is essentially a row in `data.frame` with class **sf**. This `data.frame` will have the normal suspects---names of things, metrics you care about---in columns and then a special column named **geometry** or **geom**. This will typically be a list-column, meaning that instead of holding characters or numbers, the contents are a list and each list is collection of 2-d coordinates that describe how to plot or draw the geometry. The image below illustrates the structure of an `sf` `data.frame`

## Workflows using `sf` objects {#sf-workflow}

Importing and transforming data in a `sf` data frame is somewhat different than using data frames because extra metadata is encoded into an `sf` object. R&A uses the following skills (as of October 2023) ...

... for basic `sf` handling:

* Distinguishing ordinary data frames and `sf` data frames
* Geocoding using an address
* Establishing a coordinate reference system (CRS)
* Identifying and using a geometry column
* Using and modifying a bounding box (bbox)
* Using spatial joins

... for mapping data:

* Using mapping packages
* Common types of map visualizations, including chloropleths and dot densities
* Accessing and transforming shapefiles
* Computing and mapping isochrones
* Computing commute times
* Layers vs. facets
* Static vs. interactive maps

... and for working with Census data:

* Census surveys
* Census geographies
* Using the Census API

### Guided example using TACO schools {#taco-gis}

Let's start by getting schools in Tarrant County (TACO). We can get these schools and their addresses from the data warehouse:

```{r get_schools_for_gis}
# library(tidyverse)
# library(ideadata)

# schools_conn <- get_schools()

# regions_conn <- get_regions() %>% 
#   filter(RegionDescription == "Tarrant County") %>%
#   select(RegionID)

# get the addresses of schools for geocoding 

# taco_schools <- schools_conn %>% 
#   inner_join(regions_conn, by = "RegionID") %>% 
#   select(SchoolShortName, SchoolStreet, SchoolCity, SchoolState, SchoolZipCode) %>% 
#   distinct() %>% 
#   collect() %>% 
#   janitor::clean_names()  

# taco_schools

# save(taco_schools, file = "./taco_schools.Rda")

load("./taco_schools.Rda")

taco_schools
```

### Geocoding

We've got schools and addresses! But that isn't sufficient to plot these schools on a map, and we certainly don't have a simple features data.frame.

The first stop is **geocoding** these addresses, which is simply getting their latitude and longitude. Doing so is very straightforward for with the `[tidygeocoder](https://jessecambon.github.io/tidygeocoder/)` package which provides a great interface to a number of different geocoders (e.g., US Census, OpenStreetMaps, geocod.io). 

```{r geocode_schools}
library(tidygeocoder)

# note that different geocoders may require a full address OR
# an address split into components
taco_schools_geocoded <- taco_schools %>% 
    tidygeocoder::geocode(
      street = school_street,
      city = school_city,
      state = school_state,
      postalcode = school_zip_code, 
      method = "osm" # we also use method = "geocodio"
    )

taco_schools_geocoded
```

Brilliant! We've got `lat` and `long` variables for those addresses. Super Cool!

Let's transform these now to a `sf` object:

```{r as_sf}
library(sf)

# st_as_sf() requires a user to specify what column(s) to use for geometry
taco_schools_sf <- taco_schools_geocoded %>%  
  st_as_sf(coords = c("long", "lat")) # use coords to specify a POINT geometry

taco_schools_sf
```

Notice that the `lat` and `long` variables are replaced by the `geometry` column.

### Coordinate Reference System

Notice in the meta-data above that CRS is `NA`. CRS refers to the Coordinate Reference System, which is a framework for measuring locations precisely as coordinates. A CRS includes a coordinate system, a horizontal datum that binds the coordinates to a real space on the spheroid Earth with an estimate of the Earth's curvature and a set of control points, and finally a projection that converts spherical coordinates to Cartesian coordinates.

You should always set this and the most common CRS in latitude and longitude as `WGS84` (used by the GPS satellite navigation system) with the following CRS string `"+init=epsg:4326"` as a formal identifier, but also more simply by its name:

```{r set-crs}
st_crs(taco_schools_sf) <- "WGS84"

# alternate ways of establishing a CRS in the same pipe

# option 1:
# taco_schools_sf <- taco_schools_geocoded %>%  
#   st_as_sf(coords = c("long", "lat")) %>%
#   st_set_crs("WGS84")

# option 2:
# taco_schools_sf <- taco_schools_geocoded %>%
#   st_as_sf(coords = c("long", "lat"),
#            crs = "WGS84")
```

### Plotting

We now have enough information to draw a map! To create a map, you need a ggmap object, a base layer map, and additional `sf` layers you want to display. All `sf` objects can be plotted if the `geometry` column is specified. The function `geom_sf()` reads the geometry column and automatically plots the data using the specified metadata.

```{r ggmap}
# renv::install("yutannihilation/ggsflabel")

library(ggmap)

# starting with a Google map can give us a quick bounding box
# this pulls appropriate Google map tiles around zip code 76117 at zoom level 11
# and becomes our base layer map
base_google_map <- get_googlemap("76117", zoom = 11)

# before creating other layers/features, create a quick map with labels
# to verify the correct bounding box and zoom level
base_google_map %>% # baselayer map
  ggmap() + # create the ggmap object
  
  # additional layers
  # plots school locations with a hotpink dot
  geom_sf(
    data = taco_schools_sf, 
    color = "hotpink",
    inherit.aes = FALSE
  ) +
  
  # adds hotpink labels of school names
  ggsflabel::geom_sf_label_repel(
    data = taco_schools_sf,
    aes(label = school_short_name), 
    color = "hotpink",
    inherit.aes = FALSE
  ) 

```

I don't always love Google Maps' look for display purposes on slides, so let's change that up with Stamen Maps, which give us different styles of map tiles. In particular, we will use `toner-lite`, which provides a neutral, grey-white background.

To get any baselayer map, you must specify the **bounding box**, or a set of longitudes and latitudes that respectively establish the left/right and top/bottom edges of the map. You can either get the bounding box attributes from the Google Map baselayer, or you can create your own.

```{r adjust_bounding_box}
# gets bounding box from Google Map base layer attributes
bbox <- bb2bbox(attr(base_google_map, "bb"))

# if you need a different bounding box, adjust the individual parameters
# using your preferred coordinates

# bbox <- c(left = -97.5, right = -97.1, top = 32.8, bottom = 32.5)

# get a new base layer map using the specified bounding box
base_stamen_map <- get_stamenmap(bbox, 
                                 zoom = 11, 
                                 maptype = "toner-lite")

base_stamen_map %>% 
  ggmap() +
  geom_sf(
    data = taco_schools_sf, 
    color = "hotpink",
    inherit.aes = FALSE
  ) +
  ggsflabel::geom_sf_label_repel(
    data = taco_schools_sf,
    aes(label = school_short_name), 
    color = "hotpink",
    inherit.aes = FALSE
  ) 
```

### Getting drive times

We are often interested in getting an **isochrone**, or a radius around a geographic feature with respect to time. Isochrones can be useful for identifying what communities are within a 10- or 15-minute drive-time of a school. This calculation requires the MapBox API, which requires an API key.

```{r get_isochrone}
#install.packages("mapboxapi")
library(mapboxapi)

drive_10min <- mb_isochrone(taco_schools_sf, 
                            profile = "driving", # can also get walking distances
                            time = 10)


schools_drive_10min_sf <- drive_10min %>%
  bind_cols(as_tibble(taco_schools_sf) %>%
              select(-geometry))


base_stamen_map %>% 
  ggmap() +
  
  geom_sf(
    data = schools_drive_10min_sf,
    aes(color = school_short_name,
        fill = school_short_name),
    alpha = .2,
    inherit.aes = FALSE
  ) +
  
  geom_sf(
    data = taco_schools_sf,
    aes(color = school_short_name),
    inherit.aes = FALSE
  ) +
  
  ggsflabel::geom_sf_label_repel(
    data = taco_schools_sf,
    aes(label = school_short_name, 
        color = school_short_name),
    inherit.aes = FALSE
  ) +
  guides(fill = "none", 
         color = "none")

```

### Some geographic filtering

```{r geo-filtering}

sf_use_s2(FALSE)
taco_area_of_max_intersection <- schools_drive_10min_sf %>% 
  filter(school_short_name == "Edgecliff") %>% 
  st_intersection(schools_drive_10min_sf %>% filter(school_short_name == "Southeast"))




base_stamen_map %>% 
  ggmap() +
  geom_sf(data = taco_area_of_max_intersection, 
          color = "goldenrod",
          fill = "goldenrod",
          alpha = .2,
              inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  
  geom_sf(data = taco_schools_sf, 
          aes(color = school_short_name), 
              inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  
  ggsflabel::geom_sf_label_repel(
        data = taco_schools_sf,
               aes(label = school_short_name, color = school_short_name),
               inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  guides(fill = "none", color = "none")

```

And what schools are found in this area?

```{r}
schools_in_overlap <- st_filter(taco_schools_sf,
                         taco_area_of_max_intersection, 
                         join = st_within)

schools_in_overlap
```

It may look like Edgecliff is within the 10-minute drive time overlap area, but in truth it is just outside of the boundary.

## Census Data

Kyle Walker has written the exceptional `[tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/)`package, with fantastic documentation, which allows you to pull US Census data sources (including the Decennial Census and the yearly American Community Survey).

Let's load it up:

```{r setup-tidycensus}
#install.packages('tidycensus')
library(tidycensus)

# NEt command saves Census API key to your .Renviron file
#census_api_key("YOUR API KEY GOES HERE")
#census_api_key(Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY"))
```

##### Getting Basic Data

There are two major functions implemented in tidycensus:

-   `get_decennial()`, which grants access to the 2000, 2010, and 2020 decennial US Census APIs, and
-   `get_acs()`, which grants access to the 1-year and 5-year American Community Survey APIs.

Let's get *median age by state* in 2010:

```{r get_decennial}
age10 <- get_decennial(geography = "state", 
                       variables = "P013001", 
                       year = 2010)

age10
```

Plotting is super duper easy:

```{r plot_decennial_data}
age10 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = reorder(NAME, value))) + 
  geom_point()
```

##### Searching for variables

How, pray tell, does one know that `P013001` is the variable for median age? Getting variables from the Census or ACS requires knowing the variable ID - and there are thousands of these IDs across the different Census files. To rapidly search for variables, use the `load_variables()` function. There are [more details on in the package's documentation page](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html#searching-for-variables).

To browse these variables, assign the result of `load_variables()` to a variable and use the `View()` function in RStudio. An optional argument `cache = TRUE` will cache the dataset on your computer for future use.

```{r view-vars}


v_2020 <- load_variables(2020, "acs5", cache = TRUE)

#View(v_2020)
```

Let's get Tarrant county:

```{r get_acs}
#| message: false
#| results: false



tarr <- get_acs(geography = "block group", variables = c( #tpotal pop
                                                    "B01001_001", 
                                                   
                                                    #male
                                                   "B01001_004", #5-9
                                                   "B01001_005", #10-14
                                                   "B01001_006", #15-17
                                                    
                                                   #Femaile
                                                   "B01001_028", #5-9
                                                   "B01001_029", #10-14
                                                   "B01001_030"),#15-17
                state = "TX", county = "Tarrant", geometry = TRUE, year = 2020)

tarr
```

## Chloropleth

Now we are summing up all school aged children (5-17 year old boy and girls):

```{r chloropleth, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

library(viridis)
tarr_school_aged<-tarr %>% 
  filter(variable %in% c("B01001_004", #5-9 Male
                         "B01001_005", #10-14
                         "B01001_006", #15-17
                         "B01001_028", #5-9 Female
                         "B01001_029", #10-14
                         "B01001_030") #15-17
         ) %>% 
  group_by(GEOID, NAME) %>% 
  summarise(tot_all_ages = sum(estimate))


base_stamen_map %>% 
  ggmap() +
  
  geom_sf(data = tarr_school_aged, 
         aes(fill = tot_all_ages), 
         inherit.aes = FALSE, 
         alpha  = .82, 
         color = NA) +
  geom_sf(data = taco_area_of_max_intersection, 
          color = "goldenrod",
          fill = NA,
          alpha = .2,
              inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  geom_sf(data = taco_schools_sf, 
              inherit.aes = FALSE, 
          color = "green") +
  theme_void() +
  
  scale_fill_viridis(option = "magma")

```

## Dot-density

Areal representation of data suffer from a few problems. One problem is that geographically large areas draw the eye and can often over-emphasize those areas versus smaller geographies. This distortion is familiar to those who follow elections, where geographically large states with small populations, like Wyoming, loom larger than geographically small, but densely populated states, like Delaware (Wyoming has 1/2 the population of Delaware, but 42x the land mass). This distortion occurs with Census geographies because blocks, block groups, and tracts are created to have roughly equal populations (e.g., Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people); these geographies are consequently larger in rural places than in urban centers.

A second issue is that it's very hard to show heterogeneity in spatial distributions. The plot above shows estimates of the count of all children aged 5-17 years in each tract. But, we may be interested in how differently distributed those students are.

A method to remedy both issues is to use **dot-density** plots which simply plot a sample of points within each geography for each group (often down sampled where each dot represents some number of people (e.g., 20 or 100 persons per dot). It's pretty straightforward to get what you need by using [`sf::as_dot_density()`](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/reference/as_dot_density.html)

```{r dot_dentsity_df, warning=FALSE}
acs_ages <- dplyr::tribble(
  ~ variable,     ~age_range, ~gender,
  "B01001_001",    "All",      "All",  
                                                   
    #male
   "B01001_004", "5-9",   "Male",
   "B01001_005", "10-14", "Male",
   "B01001_006", "15-17", "Male",
    
   #Femaile
   "B01001_028", "5-9",    "female",
   "B01001_029", "10-14", "female",
   "B01001_030", "15-17", "female"
)

tarr_childs <- tarr %>% inner_join(acs_ages) %>% 
  filter(gender != "All") %>% 
  select(-variable, -moe, -gender) %>% 
  group_by(GEOID, NAME, age_range) %>% 
  mutate(n_children = sum(estimate))


tarr_dots <- tarr_childs %>% 
  as_dot_density(
    value = "n_children",
    values_per_dot = 20,
    group = "age_range"
  ) 


```

```{r dot_density_map}
base_stamen_map %>% 
  ggmap() +
  
  geom_sf(data = tarr_dots, 
         aes(color = age_range), 
         inherit.aes = FALSE, 
         alpha  = .25,
         size=.25) +
  geom_sf(data = taco_area_of_max_intersection, 
          color = "goldenrod",
          fill = "goldenrod",
          alpha = .2,
              inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  geom_sf(data = taco_schools_sf, 
              inherit.aes = FALSE, 
          color = "green", 
          size = 3) +
  theme_void() +
  
  scale_color_viridis(option = "viridis", discrete = TRUE)
```
