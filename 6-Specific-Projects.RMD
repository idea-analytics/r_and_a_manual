# Specific Projects

The R&A Team works on all sorts of projects and topics. This section provides more information about our specific projects.

Some of our data analysis work is done on an annual basis, such as analyzing academic performance on state standardized tests or student persistence. In other project areas, we analyze data and share updates on a weekly or monthly basis (i.e., senior college applications, ACT test scores). We also conduct in-depth analyses that may involve multiple quantitative, machine learning, and qualitative methods to gain breadth and depth for understanding a particular topic. Grant-funded evaluation work is another example of our specific projects.

## We could move content
